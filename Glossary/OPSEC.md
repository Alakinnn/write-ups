> OPSEC - Operational security is a term used to describe practices that protect information's integrity, availabiliy and confidentiality from adversaries, including but not limited to:
- Reusage of any kind of data that recognisable such as emails, username on platforms
- Using any kind of identifiable metadata that may reveal names, GPS, timestamps...
- Posting publicly on platform
- Not using a VPN or proxy

## Study Cases
### AlphaBay Admin Takedown

One of the most spectacular OPSEC failures involved Alexandre Cazes, the administrator of AlphaBay, one of the largest dark web marketplaces:

- Cazes used the email address "[pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com](mailto:pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com)" in early welcome emails from the site.
- This email included his year of birth and other identifying information.
- He cashed out using a Bitcoin account tied to his real name.
- Cazes reused the username "Alpha02" across multiple platforms, linking his dark web identity to forum posts under his real name.

### Chinese Military Hacking Group (APT1)

There's also the notorious Chinese hacking group APT1, which made several OPSEC blunders:

- One member, Wang Dong, signed his malware code with the nickname "Ugly Gorilla".
- This nickname was linked to programming forum posts associated with his real name.
- The group used predictable naming conventions for users, code, and passwords.
- Their activity consistently aligned with Beijing business hours, making their location obvious.

These failures provided enough information for cyber security researchers and law enforcement to publicly identify group members.
