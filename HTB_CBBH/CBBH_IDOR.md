## What Makes an IDOR Vulnerability

Just exposing a direct reference to an internal object or resource is not a vulnerability in itself. However, this may make it possible to exploit another vulnerability: a `weak access control system`. Many web applications restrict users from accessing resources by restricting them from accessing the pages, functions, and APIs that can retrieve these resources. However, what would happen if a user somehow got access to these pages (e.g., through a shared/guessed link)? Would they still be able to access the same resources by simply having the link to access them? If the web application did not have an access control system on the back-end that compares the user's authentication to the resource's access list, they might be able to.
# Identifying IDORs

---

## URL Parameters & APIs
In the most basic cases, we can try incrementing the values of the object references to retrieve other data, like (`?uid=2`) or (`?filename=file_2.pdf`). We can also use a fuzzing application to try thousands of variations and see if they return any data. Any successful hits to files that are not our own would indicate an IDOR vulnerability.

## AJAX Calls
Some web applications developed in JavaScript frameworks may insecurely place all function calls on the front-end and use the appropriate ones based on the user role.
```javascript
function changeUserPassword() {
    $.ajax({
        url:"change_password.php",
        type: "post",
        dataType: "json",
        data: {uid: user.uid, password: user.password, is_admin: is_admin},
        success:function(result){
            //
        }
    });
}
```
## Understand Hashing/Encoding
Suppose the reference was encoded with a common encoder (e.g. `base64`). In that case, we could decode it and view the plaintext of the object reference, change its value, and then encode it again to access other data. For example, if we see a reference like (`?filename=ZmlsZV8xMjMucGRm`), we can immediately guess that the file name is `base64` encoded (from its character set), which we can decode to get the original object reference of (`file_123.pdf`). Then, we can try encoding a different object reference (e.g. `file_124.pdf`) and try accessing it with the encoded object reference (`?filename=ZmlsZV8xMjQucGRm`), which may reveal an IDOR vulnerability if we were able to retrieve any data.

On the other hand, the object reference may be hashed, like (`download.php?filename=c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c`). At a first glance, we may think that this is a secure object reference, as it is not using any clear text or easy encoding. However, if we look at the source code, we may see what is being hashed before the API call is made:

```javascript
$.ajax({
    url:"download.php",
    type: "post",
    dataType: "json",
    data: {filename: CryptoJS.MD5('file_1.pdf').toString()},
    success:function(result){
        //
    }
});
```
## Compare User Roles

If we want to perform more advanced IDOR attacks, we may need to register multiple users and compare their HTTP requests and object references. This may allow us to understand how the URL parameters and unique identifiers are being calculated and then calculate them for other users to gather their data.

For example, if we had access to two different users, one of which can view their salary after making the following API call:
```json
{
  "attributes" : 
    {
      "type" : "salary",
      "url" : "/services/data/salaries/users/1"
    },
  "Id" : "1",
  "Name" : "User1"

}
```

The second user may not have all of these API parameters to replicate the call and should not be able to make the same call as `User1`. However, with these details at hand, we can try repeating the same API call while logged in as `User2` to see if the web application returns anything. Such cases may work if the web application only requires a valid logged-in session to make the API call but has no access control on the back-end to compare the caller's session with the data being called.
