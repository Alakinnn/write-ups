The use of plugins makes a pentester's life even easier, bringing the functionality of well-known software into the `msfconsole` or Metasploit Pro environments. Whereas before, we needed to cycle between different software to import and export results, setting options and parameters over and over again, now, with the use of plugins, everything is automatically documented by msfconsole into the database we are using and hosts, services and vulnerabilities are made available at-a-glance for the user. [Plugins](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rapid7/metasploit-framework/Msf/Plugin) work directly with the API and can be used to manipulate the entire framework. They can be useful for automating repetitive tasks, adding new commands to the `msfconsole`, and extending the already powerful framework.

## Using Plugins

To start using a plugin, we will need to ensure it is installed in the correct directory on our machine. Navigating to `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins`, which is the default directory for every new installation of `msfconsole`, should show us which plugins we have to our availability:

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins

aggregator.rb      beholder.rb        event_tester.rb  komand.rb     msfd.rb    nexpose.rb   request.rb  session_notifier.rb  sounds.rb  token_adduser.rb  wmap.rb
alias.rb           db_credcollect.rb  ffautoregen.rb   lab.rb        msgrpc.rb  openvas.rb   rssfeed.rb  session_tagger.rb    sqlmap.rb  token_hunter.rb
auto_add_route.rb  db_tracker.rb      ips_filter.rb    libnotify.rb  nessus.rb  pcap_log.rb  sample.rb   socket_logger.rb     thread.rb  wiki.rb
```

If the plugin is found here, we can fire it up inside `msfconsole` and will be met with the greeting output for that specific plugin, signaling that it was successfully loaded in and is now ready to use:
```shell-session
msf6 > load nessus

[*] Nessus Bridge for Metasploit
[*] Type nessus_help for a command listing
[*] Successfully loaded Plugin: Nessus


msf6 > nessus_help

Command                     Help Text
-------                     ---------
Generic Commands            
-----------------           -----------------
nessus_connect            
```

## Installing new Plugins

New, more popular plugins are installed with each update of the Parrot OS distro as they are pushed out towards the public by their makers, collected in the Parrot update repo. To install new custom plugins not included in new updates of the distro, we can take the .rb file provided on the maker's page and place it in the folder at `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins` with the proper permissions.

For example, let us try installing [DarkOperator's Metasploit-Plugins](https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins.git). Then, following the link above, we get a couple of Ruby (`.rb`) files which we can directly place in the folder mentioned above.

#### Downloading MSF Plugins

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ ls Metasploit-Plugins

aggregator.rb      ips_filter.rb  pcap_log.rb          sqlmap.rb
alias.rb           komand.rb      pentest.rb           thread.rb
auto_add_route.rb  lab.rb         request.rb           token_adduser.rb
beholder.rb        libnotify.rb   rssfeed.rb           token_hunter.rb
db_credcollect.rb  msfd.rb        sample.rb            twitt.rb
db_tracker.rb      msgrpc.rb      session_notifier.rb  wiki.rb
event_tester.rb    nessus.rb      session_tagger.rb    wmap.rb
ffautoregen.rb     nexpose.rb     socket_logger.rb
growl.rb           openvas.rb     sounds.rb
```

Here we can take the plugin `pentest.rb` as an example and copy it to `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins`.

#### MSF - Copying Plugin to MSF

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo cp ./Metasploit-Plugins/pentest.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/pentest.rb
```

Afterward, launch `msfconsole` and check the plugin's installation by running the `load` command. After the plugin has been loaded, the `help menu` at the `msfconsole` is automatically extended by additional functions.

#### MSF - Load Plugin

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole -q

msf6 > load pentest

## Mixins

The Metasploit Framework is written in Ruby, an object-oriented programming language. This plays a big part in what makes `msfconsole` excellent to use. Mixins are one of those features that, when implemented, offer a large amount of flexibility to both the creator of the script and the user.

Mixins are classes that act as methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. Thus, it would be deemed inappropriate to call it inheritance but rather inclusion. They are mainly used when we:

1. Want to provide a lot of optional features for a class.
2. Want to use one particular feature for a multitude of classes.

Most of the Ruby programming language revolves around Mixins as Modules. The concept of Mixins is implemented using the word `include`, to which we pass the name of the module as a `parameter`. We can read more about mixins [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Metasploit/UsingMixins).

	If we are just starting with Metasploit, we should not worry about the use of Mixins or their impact on our assessment. However, they are mentioned here as a note of how complex the customization of Metasploit can become.
