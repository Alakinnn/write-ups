`Targets` are unique operating system identifiers taken from the versions of those specific operating systems which adapt the selected exploit module to run on that particular version of the operating system. The `show targets` command issued within an exploit module view will display all available vulnerable targets for that specific exploit, while issuing the same command in the root menu, outside of any selected exploit module, will let us know that we need to select an exploit module first.

When looking at our previous exploit module, this would be what we see:

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > options
snip...

Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Automatic
```
## Selecting a Target

We can see that there is only one general type of target set for this type of exploit. What if we change the exploit module to something that needs more specific target ranges? The following exploit is aimed at:

- `MS12-063 Microsoft Internet Explorer execCommand Use-After-Free Vulnerability`.

If we want to find out more about this specific module and what the vulnerability behind it does, we can use the `info` command. This command can help us out whenever we are unsure about the origins or functionality of different exploits or auxiliary modules. Keeping in mind that it is always considered best practice to audit our code for any artifact generation or 'additional features', the `info` command should be one of the first steps we take when using a new module. This way, we can familiarize ourselves with the exploit functionality while assuring a safe, clean working environment for both our clients and us.

#### MSF - Target Selection

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf) > info

       Name: MS12-063 Microsoft Internet Explorer execCommand Use-After-Free Vulnerability 
     Module: exploit/windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf
   Platform: Windows
       Arch: 
 Privileged: No
    License: Metasploit Framework License (BSD)
       Rank: Good
  Disclosed: 2012-09-14

Available targets:
  Id  Name
  --  ----
  0   Automatic
  1   IE 7 on Windows XP SP3
  2   IE 8 on Windows XP SP3
  3   IE 7 on Windows Vista
  4   IE 8 on Windows Vista
  5   IE 8 on Windows 7
  6   IE 9 on Windows 7
```

Looking at the description, we can get a general idea of what this exploit will accomplish for us. Keeping this in mind, we would next want to check which versions are vulnerable to this exploit.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf) > show targets

Exploit targets:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Automatic
   1   IE 7 on Windows XP SP3
   2   IE 8 on Windows XP SP3
   3   IE 7 on Windows Vista
   4   IE 8 on Windows Vista
   5   IE 8 on Windows 7
   6   IE 9 on Windows 7


msf6 exploit(windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf) > set target 6

target => 6
```

## Target Types

There is a large variety of target types. Every target can vary from another by service pack, OS version, and even language version. It all depends on the return address and other parameters in the target or within the exploit module.

The return address can vary because a particular language pack changes addresses, a different software version is available, or the addresses are shifted due to hooks. It is all determined by the type of return address required to identify the target. This address can be `jmp esp`, a jump to a specific register that identifies the target, or a `pop/pop/ret`. For more on the topic of return addresses, see the [Stack-Based Buffer Overflows on Windows x86](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/89/section/931) module. Comments in the exploit module's code can help us determine what the target is defined by.

To identify a target correctly, we will need to:

- Obtain a copy of the target binaries
- Use msfpescan to locate a suitable return address
