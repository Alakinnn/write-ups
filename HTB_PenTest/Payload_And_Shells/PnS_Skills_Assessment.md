## Host 1
![[Pasted image 20250212181227.png]]
First started the exploit by nmap enumeration to find RDP is the only service on the foothold.

I used the credentials given from the requirements to login to the foothold to find a file that contains some interesting credentials.

![[Pasted image 20250212181514.png]]

It asks for the hostname of host 1 on 172.16.1.11:8080 so I did an nmap scan on the foothold to find this information

I also found that the host runs on an Apache Tomcat 10.0.11 server

I has an SMB but running on a version EternalBlue cant be used

Since we already have a credentials to the tomcat server, I will try this first

Apparently, that does not work

It seems, when we visit the website (open browser by entering firefox). We can upload a War file, which we can utlize burpsuite and upload a shell here

We can use the second one since the target is a Tomcat webpage

Created a payload and start netcat

One mistake I didn't seem to check is that that Host i used is a public host, whose outbound is probably blocked. I `ip addr` to see the foothold's ip is 172.16.1.5 instead

After uploading and accessing the file, the reverse shell works
![[Pasted image 20250212194916.png]]

`dir` the root folder

## Host 2
This is unmecessary but I wanna check what's the ip for host to is.

I can use the credentials found earlier to access Slade Wilson's account

Hist account also post an RCE, lets try that. it is an RCE payload, but i cant find one on metasploit so let's craft one

The shell is painfully slow so I can't scroll up and give screenshots

1. When I do a searchsploit 50064.rb (it says that the file should be in exploit/php/webapps)
2. but when i do a normal search, the 50064 doesn't show up
3. I manually create an rb file and nano the content (the website is inaccessible somehow)
4. After I sudo mkdir the required path, and move the file there
5. rerun msfconsole and reload_all to make sure it shows
6. Enter all the options and cd all the way to root![[Pasted image 20250212214849.png]]


## Host 3
I first ran an nmap -sS -A -v IP to see the host. I also find that it has a website and an SMB with MS 2016 which is obviously vulnerable so I tried the obvious
![[Pasted image 20250214230936.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250214230949.png]]

but it doesn't work.

i go into the website to see an upload functionality
the upload is multipart type
![[Pasted image 20250214231047.png]]
Somehow it doesnt work
![[Pasted image 20250214231555.png]]
the problem with eternalblue is that i forgot to set the LHOST to its private network ip
After setting the correct ip, it works
