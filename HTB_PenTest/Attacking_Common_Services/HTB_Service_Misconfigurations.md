## Authentication
Administrators should be required to comply with a minimum password complexity to avoid user and passwords combinations such as:

```shell-session
admin:admin
admin:password
admin:<blank>
root:12345678
administrator:Password
```

Once we grab the service banner, the next step should be to identify possible default credentials. If there are no default credentials, we can try the weak username and password combinations listed above.

#### Anonymous Authentication

Another misconfiguration that can exist in common services is anonymous authentication. The service can be configured to allow anonymous authentication, allowing anyone with network connectivity to the service without being prompted for authentication.

#### Misconfigured Access Rights
Misconfigured access rights are when user accounts have incorrect permissions. The bigger problem could be giving people lower down the chain of command access to private information that only managers or administrators should have.

## Unnecessary Defaults
The initial configuration of devices and software may include but is not limited to settings, features, files, and credentials. Those default values are usually aimed at usability rather than security. Leaving it default is not a good security practice for a production environment. Unnecessary defaults are those settings we need to change to secure a system by reducing its attack surface.
