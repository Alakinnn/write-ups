## Enumeration

`Nmap` default scripts `-sC` includes the [ftp-anon](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-anon.html) Nmap script which checks if a FTP server allows anonymous logins. The version enumeration flag `-sV` provides interesting information about FTP services, such as the FTP banner, which often includes the version name. We can use the `ftp` client or `nc` to interact with the FTP service. By default, FTP runs on TCP port 21.

## Misconfigurations

As we discussed, anonymous authentication can be configured for different services such as FTP. To access with anonymous login, we can use the `anonymous` username and no password.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ ftp 192.168.2.142    
                     
Connected to 192.168.2.142.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
Name (192.168.2.142:kali): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
```

## Protocol Specifics Attacks

Many different attacks and methods are protocol-based. However, it is essential to note that we are not attacking the individual protocols themselves but the services that use them. Since there are dozens of services for a single protocol and they process the corresponding information differently, we will look at some.

#### Brute Forcing

If there is no anonymous authentication available, we can also brute-force the login for the FTP services using a list of the pre-generated usernames and passwords. There are many different tools to perform a brute-forcing attack. Let us explore one of them, [Medusa](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa). With `Medusa`, we can use the option `-u` to specify a single user to target, or you can use the option `-U` to provide a file with a list of usernames. The option `-P` is for a file containing a list of passwords. We can use the option `-M` and the protocol we are targeting (FTP) and the option `-h` for the target hostname or IP address.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ medusa -u fiona -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -h 10.129.203.7 -M ftp

#### FTP Bounce Attack

An FTP bounce attack is a network attack that uses FTP servers to deliver outbound traffic to another device on the network. The attacker uses a `PORT` command to trick the FTP connection into running commands and getting information from a device other than the intended server.

Consider we are targetting an FTP Server `FTP_DMZ` exposed to the internet. Another device within the same network, `Internal_DMZ`, is not exposed to the internet. We can use the connection to the `FTP_DMZ` server to scan `Internal_DMZ` using the FTP Bounce attack and obtain information about the server's open ports. Then, we can use that information as part of our attack against the infrastructure.


The `Nmap` -b flag can be used to perform an FTP bounce attack:

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ nmap -Pn -v -n -p80 -b anonymous:password@10.10.110.213 172.17.0.2

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-27 04:55 EDT
Resolved FTP bounce attack proxy to 10.10.110.213 (10.10.110.213).
Attempting connection to ftp://anonymous:password@10.10.110.213:21

PORT   STATE  SERVICE

<SNIP>
```

Modern FTP servers include protections that, by default, prevent this type of attack, but if these features are misconfigured in modern-day FTP servers, the server can become vulnerable to an FTP Bounce attack.

I first scan the IP, but the NSE ftp-anon doesnt run
![[Pasted image 20250222135558.png]]

Dont know why, so I use Metasploit to check if i can login as anon![[Pasted image 20250222135628.png]]

Found 2 files
![[Pasted image 20250222135639.png]]

i then use the info to bruteforce for a ssh

# Latest FTP Vulnerabilities

In this case, we will discuss the `CoreFTP before build 727` vulnerability assigned [CVE-2022-22836](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22836). This vulnerability is for an FTP service that does not correctly process the `HTTP PUT` request and leads to an `authenticated directory`/`path traversal,` and `arbitrary file write` vulnerability. This vulnerability allows us to write files outside the directory to which the service has access.

## The Concept of the Attack

This FTP service uses an HTTP `POST` request to upload files. However, the CoreFTP service allows an HTTP `PUT` request, which we can use to write content to files. Let's have a look at the attack based on our concept. The [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50652) for this attack is relatively straightforward, based on a single `cURL` command.

#### CoreFTP Exploitation

```shell-session
[!bash!]$ curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: <IP>" --basic -u <username>:<password> --data-binary "PoC." --path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../../whoops
```

We create a raw HTTP `PUT` request (`-X PUT`) with basic auth (`--basic -u <username>:<password>`), the path for the file (`--path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../whoops`), and its content (`--data-binary "PoC."`) with this command. Additionally, we specify the host header (`-H "Host: <IP>"`) with the IP address of our target system.

#### Directory Traversal

|**Step**|**Directory Traversal**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`1.`|The user specifies the type of HTTP request with the file's content, including escaping characters to break out of the restricted area.|`Source`|
|`2.`|The changed type of HTTP request, file contents, and path entered by the user are taken over and processed by the process.|`Process`|
|`3.`|The application checks whether the user is authorized to be in the specified path. Since the restrictions only apply to a specific folder, all permissions granted to it are bypassed as it breaks out of that folder using the directory traversal.|`Privileges`|
|`4.`|The destination is another process that has the task of writing the specified contents of the user on the local system.|`Destination`|

Up to this point, we have bypassed the constraints imposed by the application using the escape characters (`../../../../`) and come to the second part, where the process writes the contents we specify to a file of our choice. This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to write contents to the target system.

#### Arbitrary File Write

|**Step**|**Arbitrary File Write**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`5.`|The same information that the user entered is used as the source. In this case, the filename (`whoops`) and the contents (`--data-binary "PoC."`).|`Source`|
|`6.`|The process takes the specified information and proceeds to write the desired content to the specified file.|`Process`|
|`7.`|Since all restrictions were bypassed during the directory traversal vulnerability, the service approves writing the contents to the specified file.|`Privileges`|
|`8.`|The filename specified by the user (`whoops`) with the desired content (`"PoC."`) now serves as the destination on the local system.|`Destination`|

After the task has been completed, we will be able to find this file with the corresponding contents on the target system.

#### Target System

```cmd-session
C:\> type C:\whoops

PoC.
```
