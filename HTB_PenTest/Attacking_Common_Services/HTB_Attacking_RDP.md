## Protocol Specific Attacks
#### RDP Session Hijacking
_Note: This method no longer works on Server 2019._

![[Pasted image 20250224121356.png]]

To successfully impersonate a user without their password, we need to have `SYSTEM` privileges and use the Microsoft [tscon.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tscon) binary that enables users to connect to another desktop session. It works by specifying which `SESSION ID` (`4` for the `lewen` session in our example) we would like to connect to which session name (`rdp-tcp#13`, which is our current session). So, for example, the following command will open a new console as the specified `SESSION_ID` within our current RDP session:

```cmd-session
C:\htb> tscon #{TARGET_SESSION_ID} /dest:#{OUR_SESSION_NAME}
```

If we have local administrator privileges, we can use several methods to obtain `SYSTEM` privileges, such as [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) or [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz). A simple trick is to create a Windows service that, by default, will run as `Local System` and will execute any binary with `SYSTEM` privileges. We will use [Microsoft sc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-create) binary. First, we specify the service name (`sessionhijack`) and the `binpath`, which is the command we want to execute. Once we run the following command, a service named `sessionhijack` will be created.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> query user

 USERNAME              SESSIONNAME        ID  STATE   IDLE TIME  LOGON TIME
>juurena               rdp-tcp#13          1  Active          7  8/25/2021 1:23 AM
 lewen                 rdp-tcp#14          2  Active          *  8/25/2021 1:28 AM

C:\htb> sc.exe create sessionhijack binpath= "cmd.exe /k tscon 2 /dest:rdp-tcp#13"

[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
```

To run the command, we can start the `sessionhijack` service :

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net start sessionhijack
```

Once the service is started, a new terminal with the `lewen` user session will appear. With this new account, we can attempt to discover what kind of privileges it has on the network, and maybe we'll get lucky, and the user is a member of the Help Desk group with admin rights to many hosts or even a Domain Admin.

## RDP Pass-the-Hash (PtH)

If we only have the NT hash of the user obtained from a credential dumping attack such as [SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager) database, and we could not crack the hash to reveal the plaintext password? In some instances, we can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like `xfreerdp`.

There are a few caveats to this attack:

- `Restricted Admin Mode`, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, we will be prompted with the following error:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/rdp_session-4.png)

This can be enabled by adding a new registry key `DisableRestrictedAdmin` (REG_DWORD) under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`. It can be done using the following command:

#### Adding the DisableRestrictedAdmin Registry Key

```cmd-session
C:\htb> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/rdp_session-5.png)

Once the registry key is added, we can use `xfreerdp` with the option `/pth` to gain RDP access:

```shell-session
[!bash!]# xfreerdp /v:192.168.220.152 /u:lewen /pth:300FF5E89EF33F83A8146C10F5AB9BB9

```

If it works, we'll now be logged in via RDP as the target user without knowing their cleartext password.

Keep in mind that this will not work against every Windows system we encounter, but it is always worth trying in a situation where we have an NTLM hash, know the user has RDP rights against a machine or set of machines, and GUI access would benefit us in some ways towards fulfilling the goal of our assessment.

## The Concept of the Attack

The vulnerability is also based, as with SMB, on manipulated requests sent to the targeted service. However, the dangerous thing here is that the vulnerability does not require user authentication to be triggered. Instead, the vulnerability occurs after initializing the connection when basic settings are exchanged between client and server. This is known as a [Use-After-Free](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) (`UAF`) technique that uses freed memory to execute arbitrary code.

#### The Concept of Attacks

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/attack_concept2.png)

This attack involves many different steps in the kernel of the operating system, which are not of great importance here for the time being to understand the concept behind it. After the function has been exploited and the memory has been freed, data is written to the kernel, which allows us to overwrite the kernel memory. This memory is used to write our instructions into the freed memory and let the CPU execute them. If we want to look at the technical analysis of the BlueKeep vulnerability, this [article](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/exploitation-of-windows-cve-2019-0708-bluekeep-three-ways-to-write-data-into-the-kernel-with-rdp-pdu/) provides a nice overview.

#### Initiation of the Attack

|**Step**|**BlueKeep**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`1.`|Here, the source is the initialization request of the settings exchange between server and client that the attacker has manipulated.|`Source`|
|`2.`|The request leads to a function used to create a virtual channel containing the vulnerability.|`Process`|
|`3.`|Since this service is suitable for [administering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/the-localsystem-account) of the system, it is automatically run with the [LocalSystem Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/the-localsystem-account) privileges of the system.|`Privileges`|
|`4.`|The manipulation of the function redirects us to a kernel process.|`Destination`|

This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to gain remote access to the target system.

#### Trigger Remote Code Execution

|**Step**|**BlueKeep**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`5.`|The source this time is the payload created by the attacker that is inserted into the process to free the memory in the kernel and place our instructions.|`Source`|
|`6.`|The process in the kernel is triggered to free the kernel memory and let the CPU point to our code.|`Process`|
|`7.`|Since the kernel also runs with the highest possible privileges, the instructions we put into the freed kernel memory here are also executed with [LocalSystem Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/the-localsystem-account) privileges.|`Privileges`|
|`8.`|With the execution of our instructions from the kernel, a reverse shell is sent over the network to our host.|`Destination`|

Not all newer Windows variants are vulnerable to Bluekeep, according to Microsoft. Security updates for current Windows versions are available, and Microsoft has also provided updates for many older Windows versions that are no longer supported. Nevertheless, `950,000` Windows systems were identified as vulnerable to `Bluekeep` attacks in an initial scan in May 2019, and even today, about `a quarter` of those hosts are still vulnerable.
