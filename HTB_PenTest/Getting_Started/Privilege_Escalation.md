I tried to check if this machine and user can be exploited via ssh but there's no ssh folder/directory => no way to escalate this via ssh path

but this reveal information regarding user2 (via user privileges)

/bin/bash technically execute something so I try putting the flag directory in there. I also try "cat /home/user2/flag.txt" but i didnt work so it was just bruteforcing.

After gaining access to user 2, I tried finding the .ssh id_rsa file using home (which is not there) and root.
After creating a new id_rsa file on my local and changing permission to 600. I obtained the second flag in the root's home directory
