## Certificate Transparency (crt.sh)

Primary Function: Historical SSL/TLS certificate discovery
Key Information Gathered:
- Active/expired subdomains
- SSL certificate details
- Domain ownership history
- Certificate authorities used

Quick Command:
```bash
curl -s https://crt.sh/?q=domain.com&output=json | jq .
```

Impact: Reveals forgotten assets, dev environments, and historical infrastructure that might be vulnerable

## DNS Enumeration (dig)

Primary Function: Domain infrastructure mapping
Key Information Gathered:
- IP addresses (A records)
- Mail servers (MX records)
- Third-party services (TXT records)
- Name servers (NS records)

Quick Command:
```bash
dig any domain.com
```

Impact: Exposes service relationships, third-party providers, and internal infrastructure design

## Shodan / Host

**Note**: shodan host - command will show the ports where as host alone will not.
Primary Function: Internet-facing asset discovery
Key Information Gathered:
- Open ports and services
- Software versions
- Geographic locations
- SSL/TLS configurations

Quick Command:
```bash
shodan host ip_address
```

Impact: Shows actual exposed services and potential vulnerabilities in internet-facing assets

## Relationships Between Tools

Input/Output Flow:
1. crt.sh → Get subdomains
2. dig → Verify subdomains and get IPs
3. Shodan → Check IPs for exposures

Cross-Reference Points:
- Certificates ↔ DNS: Validate active infrastructure
- DNS ↔ Shodan: Confirm exposed services
- Shodan ↔ Certificates: Verify SSL configurations

Attack Surface Components:
- Forgotten assets (from Certificates)
- Misconfigurations (from DNS)
- Exposed services (from Shodan)

## Common Patterns to Watch

High-Value Findings:
- Outdated certificates
- Non-standard DNS records
- Exposed development servers
- Cloud storage endpoints
- Internal system information leaks
- Legacy/forgotten systems

Red Flags:
- SSL misconfigurations
- Exposed admin interfaces
- Unpatched services
- Test/staging environments
- Developer tool exposure
