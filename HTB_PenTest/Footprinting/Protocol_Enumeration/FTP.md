## TFTP
`Trivial File Transfer Protocol` (`TFTP`) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it `does not` provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. In addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses `UDP`, making it an unreliable protocol and causing it to use UDP-assisted application layer recovery.

| **Commands** | **Description**                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect`    | Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.                                                                     |
| `get`        | Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.                                                               |
| `put`        | Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.                                                             |
| `quit`       | Exits tftp.                                                                                                                            |
| `status`     | Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on. |
| `verbose`    | Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.                                             |

## Default Configuration
### vsFTPd
This is technically the server file. The vsFTPd server is only one of a few FTP servers available to us.
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install vsftpd 
```

Settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `listen=NO` | Run from inetd or as a standalone daemon? |
| `listen_ipv6=YES` | Listen on IPv6? |
| `anonymous_enable=NO` | Enable Anonymous access? |
| `local_enable=YES` | Allow local users to login? |
| `dirmessage_enable=YES` | Display active directory messages when users go into certain directories? |
| `use_localtime=YES` | Use local time? |
| `xferlog_enable=YES` | Activate logging of uploads/downloads? |
| `connect_from_port_20=YES` | Connect from port 20? |
| `secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty` | Name of an empty directory |
| `pam_service_name=vsftpd` | This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use. |
| `rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem` | The last three options specify the location of the RSA certificate to use for SSL encrypted connections. |
| `rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key` | - |
| `ssl_enable=NO` | - |

#### FTPUsers
In addition, there is a file called `/etc/ftpusers` that we also need to pay attention to, as this file is used to deny certain users access to the FTP service. In the following example, the users `guest`, `john`, and `kevin` are not permitted to log in to the FTP service, even if they exist on the Linux system.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/ftpusers

guest
john
kevin
```

#### Dangerous Settings

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dirmessage_enable=YES`        | Show a message when they first enter a new directory?                              |
| `chown_uploads=YES`            | Change ownership of anonymously uploaded files?                                    |
| `chown_username=username`      | User who is given ownership of anonymously uploaded files.                         |
| `local_enable=YES`             | Enable local users to login?                                                       |
| `chroot_local_user=YES`        | Place local users into their home directory?                                       |
| `chroot_list_enable=YES`       | Use a list of local users that will be placed in their home directory?             |
| **Setting**                    | **Description**                                                                    |
| `anonymous_enable=YES`         | Allowing anonymous login?                                                          |
| `anon_upload_enable=YES`       | Allowing anonymous to upload files?                                                |
| `anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES`  | Allowing anonymous to create new directories?                                      |
| `no_anon_password=YES`         | Do not ask anonymous for password?                                                 |
| `anon_root=/home/username/ftp` | Directory for anonymous.                                                           |
| `write_enable=YES`             | Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE? |
| **Setting**                    | **Description**                                                                    |
| `hide_ids=YES`                 | All user and group information in directory listings will be displayed as "ftp".   |
| `ls_recurse_enable=YES`        | Allows the use of recurse listings.                                                |
if the `hide_ids=YES` setting is present, the UID and GUID representation of the service will be overwritten, making it more difficult for us to identify with which rights these files are written and uploaded.

Another helpful setting we can use for our purposes is the `ls_recurse_enable=YES`. This is often set on the vsFTPd server to have a better overview of the FTP directory structure, as it allows us to see all the visible content at once.

The default script scan is based on the services' fingerprints, responses, and standard ports. Once Nmap has detected the service, it executes the marked scripts one after the other, providing different information. For example, the [ftp-anon](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-anon.html) NSE script checks whether the FTP server allows anonymous access. If so, the contents of the FTP root directory are rendered for the anonymous user.

The `ftp-syst`, for example, executes the `STAT` command, which displays information about the FTP server status. This includes configurations as well as the version of the FTP server. Nmap also provides the ability to trace the progress of NSE scripts at the network level if we use the `--script-trace` option in our scans. This lets us see what commands Nmap sends, what ports are used, and what responses we receive from the scanned server.

## Service Interaction

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
```

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.136 21
```

It looks slightly different if the FTP server runs with TLS/SSL encryption. Because then we need a client that can handle TLS/SSL. For this, we can use the client `openssl` and communicate with the FTP server. The good thing about using `openssl` is that we can see the SSL certificate, which can also be helpful.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp
