## Definition
[Intelligent Platform Management Interface](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/IPMI_Basics) (`IPMI`) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring.

IPMI is typically used in three ways:

- Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
- When the host is fully powered down
- Access to a host after a system failure

The IPMI protocol was first published by Intel in 1998 and is now supported by over 200 system vendors, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Supermicro, Intel, and more. Systems using IPMI version 2.0 can be administered via serial over LAN, giving sysadmins the ability to view serial console output in band. To function, IPMI requires the following components:

- Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - A micro-controller and essential component of an IPMI
- Intelligent Chassis Management Bus (ICMB) - An interface that permits communication from one chassis to another
- Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) - extends the BMC
- IPMI Memory - stores things such as the system event log, repository store data, and more
- Communications Interfaces - local system interfaces, serial and LAN interfaces, ICMB and PCI Management Bus


## Port
IPMI communicates over port 623 UDP.

## Footprinting

Many BMCs (including HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI) expose a web-based management console, some sort of command-line remote access protocol such as Telnet or SSH, and the port 623 UDP, which, again, is for the IPMI network protocol. Below is a sample Nmap scan using the Nmap [ipmi-version](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ipmi-version.html) NSE script to footprint the service.

#### Nmap

```shell-session
[!bash!]$ sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-11-04 21:48 GMT
Nmap scan report for ilo.inlanfreight.local (172.16.2.2)
Host is up (0.00064s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE

MAC Address: 14:03:DC:674:18:6A (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.46 seconds
```

Here, we can see that the IPMI protocol is indeed listening on port 623, and Nmap has fingerprinted version 2.0 of the protocol. We can also use the Metasploit scanner module [IPMI Information Discovery (auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version)](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version/).

#### Metasploit Version Scan

```shell-session
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > set rhosts 10.129.42.195
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > show options 

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version):

   Name       Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----       ---------------  --------  -----------
   BATCHSIZE  256              yes       The number of hosts to probe in each set
   RHOSTS     10.129.42.195    yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
   RPORT      623              yes       The target port (UDP)
   THREADS    10               yes       The number of concurrent threads

```


During internal penetration tests, we often find BMCs where the administrators have not changed the default password. Some unique default passwords to keep in our cheatsheets include:

|Product|Username|Password|
|---|---|---|
|Dell iDRAC|root|calvin|
|HP iLO|Administrator|randomized 8-character string consisting of numbers and uppercase letters|
|Supermicro IPMI|ADMIN|ADMIN|

It is also essential to try out known default passwords for ANY services that we discover, as these are often left unchanged and can lead to quick wins. When dealing with BMCs, these default passwords may gain us access to the web console or even command line access via SSH or Telnet.

## !!IMPORTANT!!
If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a [flaw](http://fish2.com/ipmi/remote-pw-cracking.html) in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC.

These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using `Hashcat` mode `7300`. In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command `hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u` which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.


> [!NOTE] Note
> `hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u` 
> This can be used with any other wordlist. ipmi.txt contains the hash needs cracking, with the format of HASH:HASH.
> `hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt /path/to/wordlist`
