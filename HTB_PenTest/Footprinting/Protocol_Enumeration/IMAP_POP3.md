## Ports
By default, ports `110` and `995` are used for POP3, and ports `143` and `993` are used for IMAP. The higher ports (`993` and `995`) use TLS/SSL to encrypt the communication between the client and server

## Configurations
Both IMAP and POP3 have a large number of configuration options, making it difficult to deep dive into each component in more detail. If you wish to examine these protocol configurations deeper, we recommend creating a VM locally and install the two packages `dovecot-imapd`, and `dovecot-pop3d` using `apt` and play around with the configurations and experiment.

In the documentation of Dovecot, we can find the individual [core settings](https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/core/) and [service configuration](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/service_configuration/) options that can be utilized for our experiments. However, let us look at the list of commands and see how we can directly interact and communicate with IMAP and POP3 using the command line.

#### IMAP Commands

| **Command**                     | **Description**                                                                                               |

## Dangerous Settings
Nevertheless, configuration options that were improperly configured could allow us to obtain more information, such as debugging the executed commands on the service or logging in as anonymous, similar to the FTP service. Most companies use third-party email providers such as Google, Microsoft, and many others. However, some companies still use their own mail servers for many different reasons. One of these reasons is to maintain the privacy that they want to keep in their own hands. Many configuration mistakes can be made by administrators, which in the worst cases will allow us to read all the emails sent and received, which may even contain confidential or sensitive information. Some of these configuration options include:

| **Setting**               | **Description**                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth_debug`              | Enables all authentication debug logging.                                                 |
| `auth_debug_passwords`    | This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged.  |
| `auth_verbose`            | Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.                              |
| `auth_verbose_passwords`  | Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.                   |
| `auth_anonymous_username` | This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism. |
## Footprinting the Service
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -p110,143,993,995 -sC
```
#### cURL
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user user:p4ssw0rd

* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." Important
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." INBOX
```

If we also use the `verbose` (`-v`) option, we will see how the connection is made. From this, we can see the version of TLS used for encryption, further details of the SSL certificate, and even the banner, which will often contain the version of the mail server.


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user cry0l1t3:1234 -v

*   Trying 10.129.14.128:993...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 10.129.14.128 (10.129.14.128) port 993 (#0)
* successfully set certificate verify locations:
*   CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```
