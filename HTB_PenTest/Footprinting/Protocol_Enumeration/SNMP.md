## Definition
`Simple Network Management Protocol` ([SNMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1157)) was created to monitor network devices. In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely. SNMP-enabled hardware includes routers, switches, servers, IoT devices, and many other devices that can also be queried and controlled using this standard protocol. Thus, it is a protocol for monitoring and managing network devices.

In addition to the pure exchange of information, SNMP also transmits control commands using agents over UDP port `161`. The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. While in classical communication, it is always the client who actively requests information from the server, SNMP also enables the use of so-called `traps/triggers` over UDP port `162`.

#### MIB

To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the `Management Information Base` (`MIB`) was created. MIB is an independent format for storing device information. A MIB is a text file in which all queryable SNMP objects of a device are listed in a standardized tree hierarchy. It contains at least one `Object Identifier` (`OID`), which, in addition to the necessary unique address and a name, also provides information about the type, access rights, and a description of the respective object. MIB files are written in the `Abstract Syntax Notation One` (`ASN.1`) based ASCII text format.

#### OID

An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined. The longer the chain, the more specific the information. Many nodes in the OID tree contain nothing except references to those below them. The OIDs consist of integers and are usually concatenated by dot notation. We can look up many MIBs for the associated OIDs in the [Object Identifier Registry](https://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/).

#### SNMPv1

SNMP version 1 (`SNMPv1`) is used for network management and monitoring. SNMPv1 is the first version of the protocol and is still in use in many small networks. It supports the retrieval of information from network devices, allows for the configuration of devices, and provides traps, which are notifications of events. However, SNMPv1 has `no built-in authentication` mechanism, meaning anyone accessing the network can read and modify network data. Another main flaw of SNMPv1 is that it `does not support encryption`, meaning that all data is sent in plain text and can be easily intercepted.

#### SNMPv2
SNMPv2 existed in different versions. The version still exists today is `v2c`, and the extension `c` means community-based SNMP. Regarding security, SNMPv2 is on par with SNMPv1 and has been extended with additional functions from the party-based SNMP no longer in use. However, a significant problem with the initial execution of the SNMP protocol is that the `community string` that provides security is only transmitted in plain text, meaning it has no built-in encryption.

#### SNMPv3

The security has been increased enormously for `SNMPv3` by security features such as `authentication` using username and password and transmission `encryption` (via `pre-shared key`) of the data. However, the complexity also increases to the same extent, with significantly more configuration options than `v2c`.

#### Community Strings

Community strings can be seen as passwords that are used to determine whether the requested information can be viewed or not. It is important to note that many organizations are still using `SNMPv2`, as the transition to `SNMPv3` can be very complex, but the services still need to remain active.

## Default Configuration

The default configuration of the SNMP daemon defines the basic settings for the service, which include the IP addresses, ports, MIB, OIDs, authentication, and community strings.

#### SNMP Daemon Config

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

sysLocation    Sitting on the Dock of the Bay
sysContact     Me <me@example.org>
sysServices    72
master  agentx
agentaddress  127.0.0.1,[::1]
view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1
view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1
rocommunity  public default -V systemonly
rocommunity6 public default -V systemonly
rouser authPrivUser authpriv -V systemonly
```

The configuration of this service can also be changed in many ways. Therefore, we recommend setting up a VM to install and configure the SNMP server ourselves. All the settings that can be made for the SNMP daemon are defined and described in the [manpage](http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpd.conf.html).

## Dangerous Settings

Some dangerous settings that the administrator can make with SNMP are:

| **Settings**                                     | **Description**                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rwuser noauth`                                  | Provides access to the full OID tree without authentication.                          |
| `rwcommunity <community string> <IPv4 address>`  | Provides access to the full OID tree regardless of where the requests were sent from. |
| `rwcommunity6 <community string> <IPv6 address>` | Same access as with `rwcommunity` with the difference of using IPv6.                  |

## Footprinting the Service

For footprinting SNMP, we can use tools like `snmpwalk`, `onesixtyone`, and `braa`. `Snmpwalk` is used to query the OIDs with their information. `Onesixtyone` can be used to brute-force the names of the community strings since they can be named arbitrarily by the administrator. Since these community strings can be bound to any source, identifying the existing community strings can take quite some time.

#### SNMPwalk

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128

iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: "Linux htb 5.11.0-34-generic #36~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 27 08:06:32 UTC 2021 x86_64"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: iso.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.10
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 = Timeticks: (5134) 0:00:51.34
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 = STRING: "mrb3n@inlanefreight.htb"
```

In the case of a misconfiguration, we would get approximately the same results from `snmpwalk` as just shown above. Once we know the community string and the SNMP service that does not require authentication (versions 1, 2c), we can query internal system information like in the previous example.

Here we recognize some Python packages that have been installed on the system. If we do not know the community string, we can use `onesixtyone` and `SecLists` wordlists to identify these community strings.

Note: 
```shell-session
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.* || dictates that it's a script
```

#### OneSixtyOne
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install onesixtyone
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128

Scanning 1 hosts, 3220 communities
10.129.14.128 [public] Linux htb 5.11.0-37-generic #41~20.04.2-Ubuntu SMP Fri Sep 24 09:06:38 UTC 2021 x86_64
```

Often, when certain community strings are bound to specific IP addresses, they are named with the hostname of the host, and sometimes even symbols are added to these names to make them more challenging to identify. However, if we imagine an extensive network with over 100 different servers managed using SNMP, the labels, in that case, will have some pattern to them. Therefore, we can use different rules to guess them. We can use the tool [crunch](https://secf00tprint.github.io/blog/passwords/crunch/advanced/en) to create custom wordlists. Creating custom wordlists is not an essential part of this module, but more details can be found in the module [Cracking Passwords With Hashcat](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat).

Once we know a community string, we can use it with [braa](https://github.com/mteg/braa) to brute-force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind them.

#### Braa

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install braa
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.*   # Syntax
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ braa public@10.129.14.128:.1.3.6.*

```

Once again, we would like to point out that the independent configuration of the SNMP service will bring us a great variety of different experiences that no tutorial can replace. Therefore, we highly recommend setting up a VM with SNMP, experimenting with it, and trying different configurations. SNMP can be a boon for an I.T. systems administrator as well as a curse for Security analysts and managers alike.
