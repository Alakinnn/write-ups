## Defintion
The `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol` (`SMTP`) is a protocol for sending emails in an IP network. It can be used between an email client and an outgoing mail server or between two SMTP servers. SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3 protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails. In principle, it is a client-server-based protocol, **although SMTP can be used between a client and a server and between two SMTP servers.** In this case, a server effectively acts as a client.

## Ports
By default, SMTP servers accept connection requests on port `25`. However, newer SMTP servers also use other ports such as TCP port `587`.

 Under certain circumstances, a server uses a port other than the standard TCP port `25` for the encrypted connection, for example, TCP port `465`.
## Workflow
On arrival at the destination SMTP server, the data packets are reassembled to form a complete e-mail. From there, the `Mail delivery agent` (`MDA`) transfers it to the recipient's mailbox.

| Client (`MUA`) | `➞` | Submission Agent (`MSA`) | `➞` | Open Relay (`MTA`) | `➞` | Mail Delivery Agent (`MDA`) | `➞` | Mailbox (`POP3`/`IMAP`) |
| -------------- | --- | ------------------------ | --- | ------------------ | --- | --------------------------- | --- | ----------------------- |
## Cons
But SMTP has two disadvantages inherent to the network protocol.

1. The first is that sending an email using SMTP does not return a usable delivery confirmation. Although the specifications of the protocol provide for this type of notification, its formatting is not specified by default, so that usually only an English-language error message, including the header of the undelivered message, is returned.
    
2. Users are not authenticated when a connection is established, and the sender of an email is therefore unreliable. As a result, open SMTP relays are often misused to send spam en masse. The originators use arbitrary fake sender addresses for this purpose to not be traced (mail spoofing). Today, many different security techniques are used to prevent the misuse of SMTP servers. For example, suspicious emails are rejected or moved to quarantine (spam folder). For example, responsible for this are the identification protocol [DomainKeys](http://dkim.org/) (`DKIM`), the [Sender Policy Framework](https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/) (`SPF`).
    

For this purpose, an extension for SMTP has been developed called `Extended SMTP` (`ESMTP`). When people talk about SMTP in general, they usually mean ESMTP. ESMTP uses TLS, which is done after the `EHLO` command by sending `STARTTLS`. This initializes the SSL-protected SMTP connection, and from this moment on, the entire connection is encrypted, and therefore more or less secure. Now [AUTH PLAIN](https://www.samlogic.net/articles/smtp-commands-reference-auth.htm) extension for authentication can also be used safely.

## Default Configuration
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"

smtpd_banner = ESMTP Server 
biff = no
append_dot_mydomain = no
readme_directory = no
compatibility_level = 2
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
myhostname = mail1.inlanefreight.htb
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost 
masquerade_domains = $myhostname
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 10.129.0.0/16
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
smtp_bind_address = 0.0.0.0
inet_protocols = ipv4
smtpd_helo_restrictions = reject_invalid_hostname
home_mailbox = /home/postfix
```

## Commands
|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AUTH PLAIN`|AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.|
|`HELO`|The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.|
|`MAIL FROM`|The client names the email sender.|
|`RCPT TO`|The client names the email recipient.|
|`DATA`|The client initiates the transmission of the email.|
|`RSET`|The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server.|
|`VRFY`|The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.|
|`EXPN`|The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.|
|`NOOP`|The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.|
|`QUIT`|The client terminates the session.|

To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the `telnet` tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server. The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, `HELO` or `EHLO`.

## Dangerous Settings

To prevent the sent emails from being filtered by spam filters and not reaching the recipient, the sender can use a relay server that the recipient trusts. It is an SMTP server that is known and verified by all others. As a rule, the sender must authenticate himself to the relay server before using it.

Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow. This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current customers.

### Open Relay Configuration

```shell-session
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```

With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.

## Interacting
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 


HELO mail1.inlanefreight.htb

250 mail1.inlanefreight.htb


EHLO mail1
```
The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue `code 252` and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found [here](https://serversmtp.com/smtp-error/).

#### Telnet - VRFY


```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 

VRFY root

252 2.0.0 root


VRFY cry0l1t3

252 2.0.0 cry0l1t3


VRFY testuser

252 2.0.0 testuser


VRFY aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

252 2.0.0 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

#### Send an Email
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.

250-PIPELINING
250-SIZE 10240000
250-ETRN
250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
```

## Footprinting the Service

The default Nmap scripts include `smtp-commands`, which uses the `EHLO` command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server.

#### Nmap

```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-27 17:56 CEST

```

However, we can also use the [smtp-open-relay](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-open-relay.html) NSE script to identify the target SMTP server as an open relay using 16 different tests. If we also print out the output of the scan in detail, we will also be able to see which tests the script is running.
