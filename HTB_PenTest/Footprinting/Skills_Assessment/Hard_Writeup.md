Started an NMAP TCP scan to discover these ports

I tried to do an IMAP brute but it doesnt work

Then I perform a UDP scan to find an SNMP and DHCP. DHCP is filtered so I do not really know what to use it for.

I tried to use metasploit to run an enum on the service but it bears no result

Using onesixtyone, I found a backup string
![[Pasted image 20250126185829.png]]

I then use the string with snmpwalk to find a user tom with his credentials

tom is a user that can be logged into the imap service we found previously
I opened all the inboxes till I find one with an email in it. I read the email, it turned out to be an SSH key, which I will use for the ssh service.

I use the key to create an id_rsa file and change the permission (Note: DON'T CAT THE FILE OR ELSE IT WILL CAUSE FORMAT ERROR, CREATE A FILE THEN NANO IT)

I tried to run as tom but it didnt work so I run as bob. The reason I know it's bob because the mail is directed from bob so I tried that

but it didnt work

So i tried to go for the bruteforce path by entering random name with this file![[Pasted image 20250126192143.png]]

somehow root was the user we are looking for. There's a sql file which can be cat and piped with grep for the result.
