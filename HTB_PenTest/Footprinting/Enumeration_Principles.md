## Definition
- Active Information Gathering: enumeration/scans
- Passive information gathering: osint

## Procedures
1. Identify targets' infrastructure (I think they are talking about IPs, domains, accessible services and whatever else is public)
2. Examine each service from the enumeration (NMap) and protocols
3. Getting a foothold without being detected



==In most cases, the main focus of many penetration testers is on what they can see and not on what they cannot see. However, even what we cannot see is relevant to us and may well be of great importance. The difference here is that we start to see the components and aspects that are not visible at first glance with our experience.==
- What can we see?
- What reasons can we have for seeing it?
- What image does what we see create for us?
- What do we gain from it?
- How can we use it?
- What can we not see?
- What reasons can there be that we do not see?
- What image results for us from what we do not see?

|1.|There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.|
|2.|Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.|
|3.|There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.|
