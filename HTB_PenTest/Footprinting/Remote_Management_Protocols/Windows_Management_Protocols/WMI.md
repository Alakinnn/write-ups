## Introduction

Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMI`) is Microsoft's implementation and also an extension of the Common Information Model (`CIM`), core functionality of the standardized Web-Based Enterprise Management (`WBEM`) for the Windows platform. WMI allows read and write access to almost all settings on Windows systems. Understandably, this makes it the most critical interface in the Windows environment for the administration and remote maintenance of Windows computers, regardless of whether they are PCs or servers. WMI is typically accessed via PowerShell, VBScript, or the Windows Management Instrumentation Console (`WMIC`). WMI is not a single program but consists of several programs and various databases, also known as repositories.

## Ports
The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on `TCP` port `135`

## Footprinting the Service

the program [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) from the Impacket toolkit can be used for this.

#### WMIexec.py

Again, it is necessary to mention that the knowledge gained from installing these services and playing around with the configurations on our own Windows Server VM for gaining experience and developing the functional principle and the administrator's point of view cannot be replaced by reading manuals.
