Windows servers can be managed locally using Server Manager administration tasks on remote servers. Remote management is enabled by default starting with Windows Server 2016. Remote management is a component of the Windows hardware management features that manage server hardware locally and remotely. These features include a service that implements the WS-Management protocol, hardware diagnostics and control through baseboard management controllers, and a COM API and script objects that enable us to write applications that communicate remotely through the WS-Management protocol.

The main components used for remote management of Windows and Windows servers are the following:

- Remote Desktop Protocol (`RDP`)
    
- Windows Remote Management (`WinRM`)
    
- Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMI`)
