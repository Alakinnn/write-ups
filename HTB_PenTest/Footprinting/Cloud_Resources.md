## Premise:
Most static or even non-static resources are hosted on popular cloud platforms. They can be detected through multiple ways such as, but not limited to the source code of the web pages, from where the images, JavaScript codes, or CSS are loaded.

## Search for URLs using Google Dorks:
intext:COMPANY_NAME
inurl:amazonaws.com | inurl:blob.core.windows.net | inurl:storage.googleapis.com

## Third-Party
Third-party providers such as [domain.glass](https://domain.glass/) can also tell us a lot about the company's infrastructure. As a positive side effect, we can also see that Cloudflare's security assessment status has been classified as "Safe". This means we have already found a security measure that can be noted for the second layer (gateway).

Another very useful provider is [GrayHatWarfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/). We can do many different searches, discover AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud storage, and even sort and filter by file format. Therefore, once we have found them through Google, we can also search for them on GrayHatWarefare and passively discover what files are stored on the given cloud storage.

#### Private and Public SSH Keys Leaked

Sometimes when employees are overworked or under high pressure, mistakes can be fatal for the entire company. These errors can even lead to SSH private keys being leaked, which anyone can download and log onto one or even more machines in the company without using a password.
