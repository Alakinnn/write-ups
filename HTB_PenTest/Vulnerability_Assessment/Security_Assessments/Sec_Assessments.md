## Introduction
Security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to `patch`, `mitigate`, or `remove` them.

There are different ways and methodologies to test how secure a computer system is.
- organizations have different compliance requirements and risk tolerance, face different threats, and have different business models that determine the types of systems they run externally and internally.
-  Some organizations have a much more mature security posture than their peers and can focus on advanced red team simulations conducted by third parties, while others are still working to establish baseline security.

Regardless, all organizations **must stay on top of both legacy and recent vulnerabilities** and have a system for detecting and mitigating risks to their systems and data.

## Vulnerability Assessment

`Vulnerability assessments` are appropriate for all organizations and networks. A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist).

A vulnerability assessment can be based on various security standards. Which standards apply to a particular network will depend on many factors. These factors can include, but not limited to:
- industry-specific and regional data security regulations
- the size and form of a company's network
- types of applications they use or develop
- their security maturity level.

Vulnerability assessments may be performed independently or alongside other security assessments depending on an organization's situation.

## Penetration Test
 A pentest is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pentesters conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible. The key difference between a pentest and an actual cyber attack is that the former is done with the full legal consent of the entity being pentested.

As with a vulnerability assessment, an effective pentest will result in a detailed report full of information that can be used to improve a network's security. All kinds of pentests can be performed according to an organization's specific needs.

- `Black box` pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications. Typically a tester will either be given network access (or an ethernet port and have to bypass Network Access Control NAC) and nothing else (requiring them to perform their own discovery for IP addresses) if the pentest is internal, or nothing more than the company name if the pentest is from an external standpoint.

- `Grey box` pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an `employee` who doesn't work in the IT department, such as a `receptionist` or `customer service agent`. The customer will typically give the tester in-scope network ranges or individual IP addresses in a grey box situation.

- `White box` pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope. The goal here is to discover as many flaws as possible that would be difficult or impossible to discover blindly in a reasonable amount of time.

- `Application` pentesters assess web applications, thick-client applications, APIs, and mobile applications. They will often be well-versed in source code review and able to assess a given web application from a black box or white box standpoint (typically a secure code review).

- `Network` or `infrastructure` pentesters assess all aspects of a computer network, including its `networking devices` such as routers and firewalls, workstations, servers, and applications. These types of penetration testers typically must have a strong understanding of networking, Windows, Linux, Active Directory, and at least one scripting language. Network vulnerability scanners, such as `Nessus`, can be used alongside other tools during network pentesting, but network vulnerability scanning is only a part of a proper pentest. It's important to note that there are different types of pentests (evasive, non-evasive, hybrid evasive). A scanner such as Nessus would only be used during a non-evasive pentest whose goal is to find as many flaws in the network as possible

- `Physical` pentesters try to leverage physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility such as a data center or office building.
	- Can you open a door in an unintended way?
	- Can you tailgate someone into the data center?
	- Can you crawl through a vent?\

- `Social engineering` pentesters test human beings.
	- Can employees be fooled by phishing, vishing (phishing over the phone), or other scams?
	- Can a social engineering pentester walk up to a receptionist and say, "yes, I work here?"
