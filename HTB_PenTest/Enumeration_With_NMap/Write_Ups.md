## Host Discovery
```shell-session
alakin2504@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:12 CEST
SENT (0.0107s) ICMP [10.10.14.2 > 10.129.2.18 Echo request (type=8/code=0) id=13607 seq=0] IP [ttl=255 id=23541 iplen=28 ]

Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.086s latency).

```

Based on the last result, find out which operating system it belongs to. Submit the name of the operating system as result.
-> The name of the OS can be determined in the replied TTL.
The reasons they even start a ping in the first place is the -PE flag. --packet-trace flag show all the packets. --disable-arp-ping means that it ping directly through the ip, not through MAC then look for ip in the ARP table.

## Host and Port Scanning
![[Pasted image 20250102014309.png]]

Looking for open TCP ports by disabling ARP, ICMP and DNS resolution. Just raw ip.

I tried to input all the open port to find a Host name among them. Dont know which one but it worked.

It was the netbios service
