For a `UNION` query to work, two key requirements must be met:

- The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
- The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

To carry out a SQL injection UNION attack, make sure that your attack meets these two requirements. This normally involves finding out:

- How many columns are being returned from the original query.
- Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.

## Determining the number of columns required

One method involves injecting a series of `ORDER BY` clauses and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs. For example, if the injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause of the original query, you would submit:

`' ORDER BY 1-- ' ORDER BY 2-- ' ORDER BY 3-- etc.`

The second method involves submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads specifying a different number of null values:

`' UNION SELECT NULL-- ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL-- ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL-- etc.`

## Database-specific syntax

On Oracle, every `SELECT` query must use the `FROM` keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like:

`' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--`

The payloads described use the double-dash comment sequence `--` to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. On MySQL, the double-dash sequence must be followed by a space. Alternatively, the hash character `#` can be used to identify a comment.

For more details of database-specific syntax, see the [SQL injection cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet).
## Finding columns with a useful data type

A SQL injection UNION attack enables you to retrieve the results from an injected query. The interesting data that you want to retrieve is normally in string form. This means you need to find one or more columns in the original query results whose data type is, or is compatible with, string data.

After you determine the number of required columns, you can probe each column to test whether it can hold string data. You can submit a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads that place a string value into each column in turn. For example, if the query returns four columns, you would submit:

`' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL-- ' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL-- ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL-- ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--`

If the column data type is not compatible with string data, the injected query will cause a database error, such as:

`Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.`

## Using a SQL injection UNION attack to retrieve interesting data
When you have determined the number of columns returned by the original query and found which columns can hold string data, you are in a position to retrieve interesting data.

Suppose that:

- The original query returns two columns, both of which can hold string data.
- The injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause.
- The database contains a table called `users` with the columns `username` and `password`.

In this example, you can retrieve the contents of the `users` table by submitting the input:

`' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

## Retrieving multiple values within a single column (depending on what database it is)

In some cases the query in the previous example may only return a single column.

You can retrieve multiple values together within this single column by concatenating the values together. You can include a separator to let you distinguish the combined values. For example, on Oracle you could submit the input:

`' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--`

This uses the double-pipe sequence `||` which is a string concatenation operator on Oracle. The injected query concatenates together the values of the `username` and `password` fields, separated by the `~` character.
