The base website is just a bunch of posts talking about API. The word "head" in the name `head-dump` may make some think of a `HEAD` request. But this challenge remind us that exploring all accessible (sometimes supposedly-inaccessible) endpoints when attack a web.


A little digging around the site (no tools involved). I found its documentation page:

The heapdump endpoint seems suspicious

### Exploitation
Getting the site gives me a download file

I open with Notepad and search for flag:
